There is a new king of online shopping, and I'm pretty sure most people didn't see it coming (not you, though, since you read ZDNET üôÉ).

I know what you're thinking. It's Temu or Shein. Nope, not even close!

Understanding the landscape

Before we get into who the new king is, we first need to understand the current landscape.

We have popular media darlings like Amazon, Walmart, and Target, who are the largest in the space, but there are also platforms that allow smaller merchants to reach a global audience, like Shopify, eBay, and Amazon's Seller Program.

Internationally, there are huge players like Alibaba, AliExpress, and so on.

For the sake of our conversation, I'll refer to these guys as ""traditional online shopping."" Traditional online shopping is challenging for several reasons, but one of the biggest issues the industry faces, regardless of size, is the rising cost of driving traffic to their online store.

Big or small, it's expensive. And ultimately, that's how the business works...

How the internet really works

Here's your crash course on how an online business operates: a merchant buys traffic using ads on platforms like Meta or Google. A customer sees an ad, clicks on it, is taken to your website, likes what you offer, and boom, you just made a sale.

Simply put, blogs, social media apps, and search engines control the flow of online traffic. Basically, they control the internet, and it's pay-to-play for the most part.

It's like a toll road for attention. I'm sure you've heard the term ""attention economy.""

This is what it really means. And this economy is made up of two players: you're either buying the attention or selling the attention.

Stay with me. I promise this is important.

Back in the day, ""traditional traffic,"" like blogs and search engines, was the dominant traffic source. Then, social media platforms started making a name for themselves, and consumers started hanging out on these platforms for hours.

Fast-forward a few years, and these social platforms like Meta are the 800-pound gorilla in the room. In other words, Zuck is Deebo from Friday, and the rest of the internet are Smokey and Craig.

These social platforms have completely changed the way we interact with each other as well as the way we shop online, with ""social commerce"" slowly but surely becoming a thing.

Your favorite influencer talks about a product they like, and the next thing you know, you've added it to your cart and you're waiting for the mailman to drop it off.

Platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest have embraced social shopping on their platforms, allowing merchants to connect and transact in a way that has never been done before.

But the new incumbent has done it in a way no one could foresee.

The Rocky Balboa of online shopping has arrived

Enter TikTok Shop, aka the new undisputed king of online shopping‚Ä¶ I'm sure you're thinking, ""Huh? How did it become the king?"" Grab a coffee, my friend, because this is the plot twist of all plot twists.

This plot twist is so good it makes Christopher Nolan jelly.

Remember how the internet runs on attention and is made up of buyers and sellers of said attention? Well, TikTok owns massive amounts of attention and is selling it to itself.

This puts traditional online shopping in an impossible situation. It's kinda like you rent a location in a busy mall, and your landlord decides he's going to sell the exact same stuff as you.

The difference is your landlord gets the best buyers and the best location, while you're paying top dollar to be in the back fighting for scraps.

TikTok has seamlessly combined content discovery and online shopping and is prioritizing traffic flow within its app.

What makes this move so unique is that when platforms try to do stuff like this, they usually end up pissing off the merchants or the customers‚Ä¶ but somehow, everyone loves TikTok Shop.

Sure, it has some growing pains, but most merchants love it, and customers are equally excited.

How TikTok Shop is winning over consumers

Consumers enjoy a seamless checkout experience while supporting and connecting with the brands they care about. In real-time, customers can see behind the scenes and talk to the brand owners in a way that has never been done before.

TikTok will almost pay you to shop by self-funding deep discounts for customers. In some cases, discounts are as much as 90% off‚Ä¶ and that's not a typo.

Merchants are flocking to set up TikTok Shops

TikTok is pulling out all the stops to make its merchants successful. It offers an Affiliate Program that connects creators and brands meaningfully and thoughtfully.

Merchants can see the actual value of a creator with metrics like how much revenue a creator generates for brands so merchants don't have to guess if creators can move the needle. In return, creators get to see if a brand is worth promoting.

But that's not all. Creators and brand owners can go live and sell their products directly from the event. It's like QVC.

They also allow merchants to connect external apps that manage customer service and order management, which is a direct attack on Shopify.

Full Disclosure: I own a TikTok Shop, and I'm here for it. With TikTok Shop, I genuinely feel like I'm a partner, and we're in it together. Sure, the customer service could be better, but it's expected at the rate it's growing.

Gen Z's latest obsession is seeing impressive growth

I know what you're thinking: ""Cool story, Les, but I don't see how TikTok Shop is the new king‚Ä¶""

I have 17.5 billion reasons why you should be paying attention. 17.5 billion is TikTok Shop's expected revenue in 2024, but keep in mind that it officially launched TikTok Shop in the US in September 2023. ü§Ø

Oh, it gets better: about 67% of TikTok users have been inspired to shop for a product they saw on the platform, even when they weren't initially looking to make a purchase.

Also: 6 reasons why I switched to a digital wallet, and you should too

Gen Z is particularly active on TikTok Shop, with 52.5% of Gen Z consumers using the platform for shopping or product discovery. It's also the preferred platform for 29.1% of Gen Z consumers starting their product search.

You heard it here first: Traditional online shopping is in trouble. With TikTok having a chokehold on attention and TikTok Shop being one of Gen Z's favorite places to shop, TikTok Shop is shaping up to be an unstoppable monopoly, bringing new meaning to vertically integrated.

But the immediate future is iffy at best

TikTok Shop isn't all sunshine and rainbows. As we speak, the US government is pushing for a TikTok ban.

President Biden signed a law in April 2024 requiring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app or face a complete ban in the US by January 19, 2025.

The concerns are primarily related to national security risks, as the US fears that TikTok, under Chinese ownership, could provide the Chinese government access to vast amounts of personal data on American users.

Federal officials are also worried about potential manipulation of information through the platform.

For now, we'll wait to see how this one plays out, but from the way I see it, this could be the only thing that saves traditional online shopping from the wrath of TikTok Shop.

President Biden pardons his son Hunter

Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter Sunday night, a reversal for the president, who repeatedly said he would not use his executive authority to pardon his son or commute his sentence.

‚ÄúI believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice ‚Äî and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision,‚Äù Biden said in his statement.

Hunter Biden was scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 12 for his conviction on federal gun charges. He also was set to be sentenced on Dec. 16 in a separate criminal case in which he pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion charges in September.

The president issued a ‚Äúfull and unconditional pardon‚Äù for any offenses Hunter Biden has ‚Äúcommitted or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024,‚Äù according to the White House statement.

Arctic blast hits post-Thanksgiving travel period

An Arctic blast has brought snow, frost and dangerously cold winds to the northern Plains, Midwest and Great Lakes, creating ‚Äúvery difficult to impossible‚Äù travel conditions on one of the busiest days of the year, as millions of Americans head home after Thanksgiving.

A National Weather Service advisory issued early Sunday warned that lake effect snow bands and showers had developed downwind of the Great Lakes in northeast Ohio, far northwest Pennsylvania, western New York and portions of northwest New York, creating hazardous travel conditions. Meanwhile, freeze alerts are in place for around 2 million people in parts of Georgia and Florida.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned New Yorkers on Saturday to avoid unnecessary travel. More than 100 National Guard troops were staged in western New York ‚Äúto support local communities,‚Äù she said in a statement.

The heaviest snow accumulations are expected east of Lake Ontario. Erie, Pennsylvania, has recorded 30 inches of snow, the highest total so far, according to the NWS.

Republicans prepare sweeping agenda for Trump's second term

Republicans are making plans to craft a huge party-line bill in the new Trump administration using the budget reconciliation process, which would allow them to pass policies involving taxes and spending without needing any Democratic votes.

Their top priorities include extending the 2017 Trump tax law, boosting border enforcement and repealing clean energy funding in President Joe Biden‚Äôs Inflation Reduction Act.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve told all the freshmen and the returning members: Be ready for a very busy first 100 days,‚Äù said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise.

President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs second-term agenda has some Americans worried about the impact on their lives and livelihoods. Gay couples are rushing to get married out of fear their rights might be rescinded, and small businesses are already preparing for Trump‚Äôs promised tariffs.

Notably, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago after Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Canadian goods.

Iran offers backing to Syria as rebels take control of Aleppo in surprise push

Iran has thrown its support behind Syria‚Äôs government after thousands of insurgents took control of the country‚Äôs second-largest city of Aleppo and seized nearby towns and villages in a swift and surprise offensive.

‚ÄúWe firmly support the Syrian army and government,‚Äù Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was quoted as saying by the state-run IRNA news agency. ‚ÄúThe Syrian army will once again be victorious over these terrorist groups as in the past.‚Äù

Muhammad Haj Kadour / AFP - Getty Images

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based war monitor, reported that insurgents led by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group had taken control of Aleppo International Airport and now control ‚Äúthe majority of‚Äù Aleppo, a surprise flare-up of activity after 13 years of civil war.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told NBC News‚Äô ‚ÄúMeet the Press‚Äù that the U.S. has designated HTS a ‚Äúterrorist enemy, so we have concerns, obviously, about that group.‚Äù Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has said Syria will continue to ‚Äúdefend its stability and territorial integrity against terrorists and their supporters.‚Äù

Meet the Press

Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., said he is supportive of President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs plans to impose tariffs on imports from a number of nations, including Canada and Mexico, pointing to the long history of the U.S. using trade as a ‚Äústrategic tool.‚Äù

‚ÄúAccess to our economy is a privilege,‚Äù Hagerty told ‚ÄúMeet the Press‚Äù moderator Kristen Welker. ‚ÄúIf you think about it, we‚Äôve made access to this economy a strategic tool ever since World War II.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight now, the United States has the most open market of any major economy in the world. We need to take a very hard look at countries that don‚Äôt have our best interests at heart, countries that are allowing our borders to be violated, and use those tariffs as a tool to achieve our ends,‚Äù Hagerty added.

The year of the veteran running back

NFL teams historically prefer to move on after a rookie deal. The longer players are in the league, the more wear and tear their bodies suffer, and running back is one of the most injury-prone positions in the league.

So it wasn‚Äôt a surprise that the New York Giants opted to let Saquon Barkley become a free agent instead of signing him to a multiyear deal. They didn‚Äôt want to commit a large part of their salary cap to an aging running back who just a few years ago tore an ACL.

But after signing with the Philadelphia Eagles, Barkley has been nearly unstoppable and is on pace to break the league‚Äôs all-time mark for rushing yards in a season. And he‚Äôs not the only veteran running back proving those long-held beliefs wrong.

Their success has general managers around the league wondering: Are they the start of something new, or are they outliers?

A record-breaking holiday box office

The ‚ÄúWicked‚Äù-‚ÄúGladiator II‚Äù combo delivered a strong box office last weekend. Adding ‚ÄúMoana 2‚Äù to the mix shattered records and propelled this holiday stretch to the highest-grossing Thanksgiving weekend ever.

The sequel to Disney‚Äôs animated hit has grossed $221 million across North America since its Wednesday release, the biggest Thanksgiving debut ever and the biggest five-day opening of all time.

Auli‚Äòi Cravalho, who was only 16 when she voiced her breakout role as Moana, spoke with NBC News about the pride she feels in celebrating the people of the Pacific on the big screen.

‚ÄúI remember watching and rewatching the movie ‚ÄòMulan‚Äô and resonating with her background of Asian/Pacific Islander and her dedication to family and culture. She also was the first princess to run off into battle and kick butt! I still watch that film even as I‚Äôm turning 24, and she‚Äôs still one of my favorites today,‚Äù Cravalho said.

As President-elect Donald Trump assembles his White House staff and selects his Cabinet picks, an ideological divide has emerged around a hot-button topic: a ban on TikTok, the social media video app used by around half of the U.S. population.

That divide and a lack of clarity around the administration‚Äôs priorities and current positioning on a ban have thrown the fate of TikTok in the U.S. into question.

TikTok is defending itself in federal court over legislation President Joe Biden signed in April that would ban TikTok if it doesn‚Äôt sell itself to an American owner by the time Trump takes office.

Further complicating matters for TikTok is the fact that Trump has reversed his public stance on the app as he has announced Cabinet picks with a wide array of views about it.

In 2020, he tried to ban it outright with an executive order that was struck down in the courts. At the time, teen TikTok users claimed to have coordinated lower turnout at one of Trump‚Äôs rallies by reserving seats they had no intention to fill. This March, Trump acknowledged that he believes TikTok is a ‚Äúnational security threat‚Äù but said a ban would double business for Meta‚Äôs Facebook, which he calls the ‚Äúenemy of the people.‚Äù

In June, Trump started his own TikTok account, which now has over 14.6 million followers, the most of any U.S. politician, although he hasn‚Äôt posted since Election Day. In a Truth Social post in September, he said he would ‚Äúsave TikTok in America‚Äù if he was elected.

If Trump sticks to his word, he could be TikTok‚Äôs best chance to avoid a ban. But that‚Äôs not a sure thing ‚Äî most of Trump‚Äôs Cabinet and other administration picks who have spoken about the app‚Äôs future have strongly encouraged a ban, with a few who have large TikTok and other social media followings opposing one.

Project 2025, the conservative playbook outlining plans for the administration, refers to TikTok as ‚Äúa tool of Chinese espionage‚Äù that should be ‚Äúoutlawed.‚Äù In his goals outlined for the Federal Communications Commission in Project 2025, Trump‚Äôs choice for FCC chair, Brendan Carr, wrote that one of his main priorities is ‚Äúreining in‚Äù big tech, including banning TikTok.

During his campaign, Trump disavowed Project 2025, a project led by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, after it became a central subject of Democratic attacks. However, at least three of his staff picks contributed to or wrote sections of Project 2025, and his transition staffers are pulling from its personnel database, according to a person familiar with the situation.

In the foreword to Project 2025, Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts writes that TikTok and other social media platforms ‚Äúare specifically designed to create the digital dependencies that fuel mental illness and anxiety, to fray children‚Äôs bonds with their parents and siblings. Federal policy cannot allow this industrial-scale child abuse to continue.‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs pick for head of the CIA, John Ratcliffe, whose nomination requires Senate confirmation, is another author of Project 2025. He plans to devote even more resources to countering China. ‚ÄúTikTok is a national security threat,‚Äù Ratcliffe told Fox Business in 2022, agreeing with the host that the U.S. should ‚Äúkick out‚Äù TikTok.

Most Trump allies who oppose TikTok have cited claims of Chinese government influence over American users, which TikTok denies. Politicians on both sides of the aisle have also referred to TikTok as a national security threat and a way for the Chinese government to get data on Americans, while its proponents have argued that such data is accessible with or without TikTok.

Even as some members of Trump‚Äôs incoming administration have advocated banning TikTok, other members have become rising TikTok stars, including Vice President-elect JD Vance, who has over 2 million followers, and press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who has posted only one video (following the popular ‚Äúday in the life‚Äù format in October) and has 36,000 followers. But Leavitt has also spoken out against the platform.

‚ÄúAs a generation Z American, I can tell you all my friends, my colleagues, my former classmates are on TikTok. It is the main source of news for the majority of American youth, and it is truly the bane of our society right now,‚Äù Leavitt said last December on Fox Business.

Referring to the Chinese Communist Party, she said: ‚ÄúIt is owned by the CCP. They are pushing algorithms that are very damaging to the intellectual curiosity and to the ideology of young Americans today.‚Äù

Sebastian Gorka, a Newsmax host and the incoming deputy assistant to the president, described TikTok as a ‚ÄúCCP instrument,‚Äù ‚Äúa way to collect data from Americans, including children, and then exploit it for the purposes of the world‚Äôs largest communist regime,‚Äù on his show in April 2023.

‚ÄúPeople want to ban it, especially on the right,‚Äù he added.

Awaiting Senate confirmation to join Trump‚Äôs Cabinet are former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, his pick for director of national intelligence, who has over 1 million TikTok followers, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump‚Äôs choice for health and human services secretary, who has over 3 million followers. They have both publicly criticized the legislation that would force a sale of TikTok or lead to a U.S. ban.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be fooled ‚Äî the TikTok ban is not about China harvesting your data. That‚Äôs a smoke screen,‚Äù Kennedy wrote on X in April, adding that he would file a lawsuit challenging the ban on constitutional grounds.

‚ÄúCongress and the administration don‚Äôt understand that TikTok is an entrepreneurial platform for thousands of American young people,‚Äù Kennedy went on to write, adding that U.S. data is harvested outside TikTok and that the company ‚Äúisn‚Äôt even majority Chinese-owned.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey want to screw them over just so they can pretend to be tough on China,‚Äù he wrote.

Gabbard told podcast host Joe Rogan in May that she opposed the legislation to force a sale ‚Äúon the grounds of free speech and civil liberties,‚Äù arguing that it would give the president unilateral power to declare a country a foreign adversary and ban any app the country owned a majority stake in.

‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äôre just going after the ones they can‚Äôt actually control and intimidate into doing their work for them,‚Äù she said.

Kennedy also spoke to TikTok users about the legislation during a livestream on the platform in June, calling it ‚Äúperverse,‚Äù ‚Äútwisted‚Äù and unconstitutional and characterizing it as private property seizure and a violation of free speech. He said young people should be encouraged to pursue entrepreneurship through monetized content and marketing on TikTok, not have it taken away.

‚ÄúI have an account on TikTok. It‚Äôs important for me to be able to communicate with people on TikTok. There‚Äôs a lot of content on TikTok I disagree with, but that‚Äôs what democracy is about,‚Äù Kennedy said. In the same appearance, he said he disagreed with the government‚Äôs decision to ban the Russian propaganda network RT.

TV personality Mehmet Oz, Trump‚Äôs pick to direct the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has 1.1 million TikTok followers, and he uses the platform‚Äôs TikTok Shop feature to earn commissions on health and wellness products he advertises from a company he advises.

Vivek Ramaswamy, who Trump has said will work alongside X owner Elon Musk in newly created government efficiency advisory roles, has over 855,000 TikTok followers. Ramaswamy flip-flopped on TikTok when he ran his own presidential campaign in 2023. In between two Iowa campaign stops, Ramaswamy went from calling TikTok ‚Äúdigital fentanyl‚Äù to joining it at the advice of Jake Paul, the controversial boxer and YouTube star.

‚ÄúIn retrospect, it was a little bit of an old-fashioned decision to say that there‚Äôs an entire mode of communicating with young people that I was going to turn off,‚Äù Ramaswamy said, although he has continued to say the app could have a worrying impact on young teens.

Musk, who doesn‚Äôt have a public-facing account, opposes a ban. ‚ÄúIn my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,‚Äù Musk posted in April. ‚ÄúDoing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.‚Äù

The Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok CEO Shou Chew has reached out to Musk since the election, looking for insight into Trump‚Äôs administration and tech policy.

Musk and Ramaswamy don‚Äôt need to be confirmed by the Senate, because their roles aren‚Äôt official government positions, although Trump said they will work to inform the Office of Management and Budget.

Trump‚Äôs incoming national security adviser, Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., voted in support of the bill to force a sale of TikTok and advocated for a ban. In February, after Biden‚Äôs campaign joined TikTok, Waltz told Fox News the campaign should be ‚Äúashamed.‚Äù He suggested the Chinese Communist Party could stage ‚Äúelection interference‚Äù on TikTok.

‚ÄúIt is long overdue,‚Äù Waltz said about a ban. ‚ÄúWe should not allow our greatest adversary to access 150 million Americans and their data.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy is it OK to ban TikTok on all government devices because it‚Äôs essentially a spyware tool ... but it‚Äôs OK to have it on our kids‚Äô phones, monitoring everything they look at?‚Äù Waltz asked on Fox Business in July 2023. ‚ÄúWe would have never allowed this in the Cold War with the Soviet Union, and we shouldn‚Äôt be allowing it now.‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs nominee for secretary of state, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been advocating against TikTok since the company first merged with the app Musical.ly in 2019. He co-introduced legislation to ban TikTok from government devices in 2021 and in all of the U.S. in 2022, supported Trump‚Äôs executive order to ban TikTok and called the legislation that would force a sale to an American owner ‚Äúa huge step toward confronting Beijing‚Äôs malign influence.‚Äù

After Trump was elected, Rubio said he would defer to him on TikTok, although he still had concerns about the ‚Äúvulnerability it poses.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the president, so if that‚Äôs what he wants to do, he also has the power to do it,‚Äù Rubio said.

In late 2022, Trump‚Äôs pick for homeland security secretary, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, and his choice for interior secretary, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, both banned TikTok from state-owned devices.

In an interview with Fox News in March, Noem said TikTok is ‚Äúowned by the Chinese Community Party. Their No. 1 desire is to destroy America, so that is why we should be alarmed at the amount of influence they have in this country.‚Äù She said TikTok was released at the same time as the Covid-19 pandemic was (it was actually released in the U.S. in August 2018) to ‚Äúinfluence our youth.‚Äù

Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, R-Ore., Trump‚Äôs pick for labor secretary, and Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., his choice for ambassador to the United Nations, both voted in favor of the bill that would force a sale to an American owner.

‚ÄúI have consistently said that Tik Tok is a national security threat,‚Äù Stefanik said in a statement in March. ‚ÄúWe cannot allow our adversaries to build an arsenal of data on American citizens that can be used to exploit and weaponize them.‚Äù

Former Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., Trump‚Äôs pick for veterans affairs secretary, told Newsmax in March 2023 that he opposed TikTok‚Äôs Chinese ownership but that the legislative path to ban it was a ‚Äútough decision,‚Äù creating a potential path to government overreach. ‚ÄúWe really don‚Äôt need the government getting into that, and that‚Äôs the problem,‚Äù Collins said.

Trump‚Äôs choice for surgeon general, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, a family and emergency medicine doctor and a former Fox News medical contributor, has personally advocated for a ban ‚Äî not just on TikTok but on all social media for children.

‚ÄúIn my opinion, social media should be banned to all teens and young children, because it‚Äôs done nothing but harm,‚Äù she said on Fox News.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.0,neutral,0.7286860942840576,Pro-ban

Sporting a sparkly dress and a Santa hat atop her distinctly pink hair, Sarah Potempa stood in front of her smartphone at her hair-care company's warehouse in Waukegan, Illinois. It was time to go to work. Potempa is a celebrity hairstylist who goes live on TikTok multiple times a week. During ""the packing show,"" as she calls it, Potempa livestreams herself as she packs up orders of her viral Beachwaver curling iron for six to eight hours at a time. The stream on Nov. 20 had a party atmosphere, with Potempa taking breaks to dance to ""In Da Club"" by 50 Cent in between shipping out orders. To the more than 1,000 TikTok users who typically tune in for Potempa's shows, this is entertainment and shopping all at once. Beachwaver is part of a growing influx of retailers that are flocking to TikTok Shop, the video app's shopping service. TikTok Shop launched in September 2023 as a way for users to purchase products without leaving the app, and since then, the China-owned app has emerged as a viable alternative for retailers looking to diversify their e-commerce business from Amazon . Via a dedicated Shop tab, retailers big and small promote products of all kinds, ranging from eyeshadow palettes, phone chargers, detox teas, treadmills and more. On TikTok, retailers typically offer generous coupons and free delivery within a few days. Shoppable posts, which look like normal videos but are ads for products sold in TikTok Shop, frequently appear in TikTok's main video feed, known as the ""For You"" page. Those posts allow users to purchase products without exiting their For You feed. On Potempa's show, shoppers race to place an order to get a 50% discount on Beachwaver products and free add-ons to their order like face washes or lipsticks, along with the chance to have their username read aloud by Potempa while she packs their order on screen. ""When TikTok Shop was new and people hadn't used it yet, they would ask, 'Is this on Amazon yet?'"" Potempa, Beachwaver's CEO and co-founder, said in an interview. ""I would get those questions like, 'Can I buy it somewhere else?' Now that it's been around for a year or so, we've done 1.2 million orders."" ByteDance-owned TikTok has already cemented itself as an advertising powerhouse, and with TikTok Shop, the company has been trying to carve out another revenue stream through e-commerce. The company has attracted the likes of Nike , PacSun and Crocs , among others. Those retailers want to tap into the more than 170 million Americans on TikTok who shop on impulse as they scroll through videos. They aren't the only ones. Amazon sellers are also being persuaded to try out the service with promises of low fees and steep discounts on products footed by TikTok. Besides sellers, the company has also hired talent away from Amazon, filling key roles for TikTok Shop in areas like marketing, creator relationships, brand safety, category managers and operations. In the 15 months since its launch, TikTok Shop has emerged as a ""massive e-commerce machine,"" according to ecommerceDB, a market research firm. EcommerceDB predicts TikTok Shop will more than double its gross merchandise volume, or the dollar value of items sold on its marketplace, to $50 billion this year. That's a fraction of Amazon's 2024 expected GMV of $757 billion, but nonetheless, TikTok Shop is making strides. ""Every time you scroll, every other scroll is a Shop post, so they're making a lot of investment to encourage that in-app conversion,"" said Caila Schwartz, Salesforce's director of consumer insights and strategy for retail and consumer goods. Amazon spokesperson Mira Dix told CNBC in a statement that sellers are engaging with its store ""more than ever before"" and seeing greater success. Dix said the company's services for sellers are optional, such as fulfillment, which costs ""an average of 70% less"" than comparable two-day shipping alternatives. ""Our selling partners are incredibly important to Amazon, and we work hard to innovate on their behalf and support the growth and success of these businesses across all of their sales channels,"" Dix said.

Beachwaver CEO Sarah Potempa hosts livestreams on TikTok Shop multiple times a week.

Looming deadline

TikTok's e-commerce push comes at a precarious moment for the company. In April, President Joe Biden signed a law that requires ByteDance to sell TikTok by Jan. 19. If TikTok fails to cut ties with its parent company, app stores and internet hosting services would be prohibited from offering the app, amounting to a nationwide ban in the U.S. TikTok has sued to block the measure. President-elect Donald Trump could rescue TikTok from a potential U.S. ban. After trying to implement a TikTok ban during his first administration, Trump reversed his stance, acknowledging in a March interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that ""there's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad"" with the app. Trump changed his position around the time that he met with billionaire Jeff Yass, who is a major investor in ByteDance. As the January deadline grows nearer, TikTok has largely been operating its business as usual. Executives from TikTok Shop pitched its marketplace as a holiday shopping destination during an October event in Manhattan with business owners and social media influencers. Users have shopped hundreds of millions of units on its e-commerce platform since launching September 2023, said Nico Le Bourgeois, TikTok Shop's head of U.S. operations. Le Bourgeois, who joined TikTok in August 2023, previously spent nearly nine years at Amazon in a variety of divisions including its third-party marketplace. TikTok Shop isn't trying to sell ""everything to everybody,"" Le Bourgeois told CNBC in October. TikTok Shop is a marketplace for product discovery that surfaces ""new, cool, interesting"" items from big and small brands, he added. ""You see it, you like it, you buy it. It's not a search,"" he said. ""It's a very different way of shopping."" Le Bourgeois declined to comment on the looming TikTok ban, but a company spokesperson at the event said TikTok Shop isn't slowing down. ""The sellers here, creators, they're building their livelihoods on TikTok,"" the spokesperson said. ""We're going to continue to show up for that. There's a huge opportunity for us.""

'Enjoying it while it's hot'

More Americans are expected to turn to TikTok and other China-linked apps for gift buying this holiday shopping season. Roughly 63% of Western consumers plan to purchase from Chinese shopping apps during the season, according to Salesforce. That includes TikTok, Alibaba's AliExpress, Shein, Temu and fast-fashion company Cider. On Saturday, TikTok said its U.S. Black Friday sales topped more than $100 million, with home goods, fashion and beauty products among the most popular categories. Canvas Beauty, a top seller of hair-care and beauty products on TikTok Shop, hit $1 million in sales within two hours of going live on the app, the company said. Retailers and sellers, some of which count TikTok for the lion's share of their online sales, told CNBC that they're sticking with the platform despite the possibility that it could disappear. Although it's impossible to ignore the conversation around a potential TikTok ban in the U.S. as a brand that heavily relies on the platform, Yay's Snacks co-founder and COO Rachel Cheng said she's not convinced that TikTok will go away under the Trump administration because it doesn't seem to be the president-elect's main focus. Yay's Snacks, which makes crispy Cambodian beef jerky, was one of the earliest companies to join TikTok Shop when it launched. Yay's co-founder and CEO Marlin Chan, a former YouTuber, frequently posts humorous TikTok videos promoting his snacks, which are based on his grandmother's original recipe. Among the videos is a series that parodies the show ""Undercover Boss."" Those videos helped Yay's amass tens of thousands of TikTok followers, who keep buying the jerky, Cheng said. At one point, TikTok sales comprised nearly 90% of Yay's total revenue, with monthly sales from the app peaking at $75,000 last November, Cheng said. Yay's is prepared to divert to Amazon and its own website if TikTok is banned, but as long as TikTok is ""still here, we're going to do what we can to stay on top,"" Cheng said. ""If we were sitting here worrying about what's next, we would've never gotten on TikTok Shop,"" Cheng said. ""We're enjoying it while it's hot.""

Competing with Amazon

Scrub Daddy, known for its smiley face-shaped sponges, went viral on TikTok during the Covid pandemic and counts more than 4 million followers. Its top video, a demonstration of its Damp Duster sponge, has 30 million views while its bestselling product on TikTok Shop has been purchased nearly 76,000 times, according to the app. That figure doesn't account for items that have been returned after purchase. After kicking off in 2012 with an appearance on ""Shark Tank,"" Scrub Daddy CEO Aaron Krause said he lost faith in traditional marketing efforts. ""We did a TV ad, we did some outdoor ads on billboards, we did a little bit of radio,"" Krause said. ""All I found was that I was throwing money into the air.""

The company pivoted toward social media marketing, primarily on Instagram, which turned out to be a ""pot of gold,"" Krause said. Scrub Daddy set up an account on TikTok in 2020 and worked with influencers to promote its products, including Vanesa Amaro, a popular account for housecleaning content with more than 5.7 million followers. After Amaro recommended the sponges to her viewers, Scrub Daddy sold 30,000 units in one weekend, Krause said. TikTok's ""algorithm just allows you to hit millions and millions of views with one hysterically crazy video,"" he said. In recent months, TikTok has encouraged retailers and sellers to host hourslong livestreams multiple times per week as a way to connect with shoppers. Many brands have invested in building out their own studios to record the shows or have hired talent to host them. Scrub Daddy snatched up longtime QVC host Dan Hughes after he was laid off from the home shopping company in 2023. Others, like Beachwaver, have turned their CEOs into on-screen talent. TikTok Shop was a big topic of conversation at a conference for Amazon sellers in New York in October. A session on ""how to scale your brand"" with TikTok Shop drew a packed room of sellers who listened to e-commerce strategist Rafay MH talk up the potential for brands to haul in $8 million to $10 million in sales from TikTok in less than a year. ""Amazon comes with a ton of competition,"" MH said. ""TikTok is the opportunity for free eyeballs and sales."" Many Amazon sellers have embraced TikTok after they were initially slow to join the platform, said Michelle Barnum Smith, who provides consulting services to online businesses. ""I was the bedraggled gold miner standing on the street corners of New York, saying 'There's gold in those hills,' and people were like, 'Yeah, sure,'"" Barnum Smith said ""But as soon as they started seeing their competition on there, or their buddy on there, they were like, 'I've got to get on there.'"" There's now ""extreme FOMO,"" or fear of missing out, among Amazon sellers to join TikTok even if it no longer exists in the U.S. next year, Barnum Smith said. ""Whatever the future looks like for TikTok Shop, they're happy to take that money now and get while the getting's good,"" Barnum Smith said. Correction: Vanesa Amaro is a TikTok influencer.

Court upholds a U.S. ban on TikTok

toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images

A federal appeals court on Friday upheld a law banning TikTok nationwide unless the viral video app was sold off by its China-based parent company, rejecting TikTok's claim that the crackdown violates the free speech rights of millions of Americans.

In its ruling, the court said that it was ""precisely"" because of TikTok's ""expansive reach"" that both Congress and the president determined that divesting it from China's control ""is essential to protect our national security.""

In its opinion, the court wrote that TikTok's ownership by a China-based company, ByteDance, represents a national security threat that surpasses the free speech concerns TikTok raised.

Sponsor Message

""The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States. Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States,"" the court wrote.

Critics of banning TikTok, including the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, were alarmed by the court's decision.

""This is a deeply misguided ruling that reads important First Amendment precedents too narrowly and gives the government sweeping power to restrict Americans' access to information, ideas, and media from abroad,"" said Jameel Jaffer, the group's executive director. ""We hope that the appeals court's ruling won't be the last word.""

A TikTik spokesman said the company plans on appealing to the Supreme Court. ""The TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people,"" the spokesman wrote. ""The TikTok ban, unless stopped, will silence the voices of over 170 million Americans.""

The ruling, by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, delivered the Biden administration a significant victory, but sets TikTok on an uncertain path.

President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to save TikTok. What that means, however, could take on several different forms .

Sponsor Message

Under the law , TikTok has until Jan. 19 to be sold off from its Beijing-based owner ByteDance, or face a nationwide ban. That deadline may be extended by 90 days if there is ""significant progress"" toward a sale. So one option could be that the enactment date is forestalled and Trump tries to broker a deal for the app to be acquired by an American company or group of investors.

China has for years opposed the forced sale of TikTok, but China analysts say officials there may now attempt to put the app on the auction block as leverage in trade talks with the incoming Trump administration. TikTok's current position, though, remains that TikTok is not for sale.

Trump can also declare that steps TikTok has taken to distance itself from ByteDance, including a plan known as Project Texas that walls off Americans' data from China, qualifies as divestiture. Trump may also instruct his attorney general to not enforce the law.

Banning TikTok is not as simple as flipping an ""off"" switch. The law targets app stores controlled by Apple and Google, forcing the tech giants to remove TikTok. And makes it illegal for web-hosting companies to support TikTok.

Google and Apple have not said how they would respond to the law. And it is unclear what exactly web-hosting firms would do, given Trump's stated goal of rescuing the app amid a looming legal deadline.

But even if the law was being enforced by a presidential administration, TikTok would slowly wither on the vine. Its 170 million American users would not see the app disappear from devices. Instead, software updates would stop being fed to the app. Over time, TikTok would become slow, glitchy and eventually unusable.

Trump, who during his first administration tried to put TikTok out of business , reversed his position on the campaign trail, citing in one social media post that a TikTok ban would only boost the business of Meta, which he has criticized for his unproven belief that the social media company hurt him in the 2020 presidential election.

A 2024 Pew Research Center poll found that a remarkable 73 percent of adult Americans believe a free press is either extremely or very important to the well-being of society‚Äîthough only a third of those polled believe that US media are completely free to report news. Indeed, half of those surveyed believe that US news organizations are influenced a great deal by corporate/financial interests (51%) or government/political interests (49%). Citing reports by the Associated Press and the Columbia Journalism Review, the Pew Research Center noted that ‚Äúrecent high-profile incidents such as a police raid on a Kansas newsroom and a government seizure of a Florida journalist‚Äôs materials have raised questions about press freedom in the U.S.‚Äù

Pew reported its findings in anticipation of World Press Freedom Day and before Reporters Without Borders (RSF) published the 2024 edition of its annual World Press Freedom Index. The United States ranked fifty-fifth among 180 nations for press freedoms in 2024, according to RSF, which defines press freedom as ‚Äúthe ability of journalists as individuals and collectives to select, produce, and disseminate news in the public interest independent of political, economic, legal, and social interference and in the absence of threats to their physical and mental safety.‚Äù RSF found press freedom is ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù in the United States, which earned a score of 66.59 out of a 100, a decline of nearly five points, compared to 2023 when the United States ranked forty-fifth in the world based on ‚Äúsatisfactory‚Äù levels of press freedom. Noting that the United States was ‚Äúonce considered a model for freedom of expression,‚Äù RSF reported that in 2024, ‚Äúmajor structural barriers to press freedom persist,‚Äù including, for instance, highly concentrated media ownership that appears ‚Äúto prioritize profits over public interest journalism,‚Äù declines in both local news and public trust in media, and the enactment of state and local laws that limit journalists‚Äô access to public spaces.

From a global perspective, RSF noted ‚Äúa worrying decline‚Äù in respect for media autonomy, increased pressure from state or other political actors, and ‚Äúa clear lack of political will on the part of the international community to enforce the principles of protection of journalists.‚Äù Nowhere has the latter been more evident than in Israeli-occupied Palestine, including Gaza especially, where RSF reported a ‚Äúrecord number of violations against journalists and the media‚Äù since October 2023, including the killing of Palestinian journalists by Israel Defense Forces.

The US‚Äôs plunging press freedom is driven by a number of factors. Legislative attacks on media during the past year are one of the most ominous. In April 2024, Congress passed what is known as the TikTok ‚Äúdivestment-or-ban‚Äù bill, which President Biden quickly signed into law. In the Senate, the legislation passed as a rider on a measure to provide $95 billion in mostly military aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, the international news agency Reuters reported. The military aid warrants concern in its own right, but the added censorship of the popular social media platform is deeply problematic. As Omar Zahzah observed in a June 2024 article for Electronic Intifada, ‚ÄúIt is no surprise that a bill furthering US funding for imperialism and genocide should also fortify US imperialism on the digital front.‚Äù

The fundamental missions of journalism are to hold the powerful to account and to give the public the information required to be citizens of a democracy.

Senator Ron Wyden, D-OR, warned that the legislation ‚Äúprovides broad authority that could be abused by a future administration to violate Americans‚Äô First Amendment rights.‚Äù Senator Ed Markey, D-MA, went further, warning, ‚ÄúWe should be very clear about the likely outcome of this law. It‚Äôs really just a TikTok ban . . . Censorship is not who we are as a people. We should not downplay or deny this trade-off.‚Äù

TikTok was ostensibly targeted because it is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company. Even though other popular social media platforms also share user data for profit, violate users‚Äô rights to privacy, contribute to the spread of misinformation and disinformation, and foster internet addiction, Congress and the White House singled out TikTok as the real threat. Their reasoning was that TikTok alone operated under Chinese influence and could share US users‚Äô data with the Chinese government.

Not long after Biden enacted the ban, which would force ByteDance to divest and allow a US company to assume control of the platform by early 2025, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) publicly admitted that the real reason TikTok had been targeted was its potential influence on the American public regarding Israel‚Äôs relentless bombardment of Palestinian civilians.

As protests spread across US colleges and universities in the spring of 2024, Romney questioned why Israel‚Äôs messaging on Gaza had been so ‚Äúawful,‚Äù noting that ‚Äútypically the Israelis are good at PR. What‚Äôs happened here?‚Äù Blinken quickly replied that those who opposed Biden‚Äôs support for Israel were being manipulated by social media, and TikTok in particular. Blinken went on to say that those pushing for a ceasefire were ‚Äúon an intravenous feed of information with new impulses, inputs every millisecond,‚Äù and ‚Äúthe way this has played out on social media has dominated the narrative.‚Äù Ryan Grim of The Intercept called the exchange an ‚Äúincredible historical document‚Äù that revealed how high-ranking US officials seek to control narratives and restrict information, especially around Israel and Gaza.

Congressional zeal to throttle freedom of information did not stop at TikTok. Echoing the xenophobia that fueled anti-terrorism legislation after 9/11, in April 2024, the House of Representatives took aim at non-profits, passing‚Äîby a vote of 382‚Äì11‚Äîlegislation that would authorize the secretary of the treasury to unilaterally remove the tax-exempt status of any 501(c)3 nonprofit determined to be a ‚Äúterrorist supporting organization.‚Äù

The legislation prompted the Charity & Security Network, a resource and advocacy center for nonprofit organizations that work in conflict zones, to warn policymakers of ‚Äúthe parade of horribles that could cascade from this broad legislation that uses the targeting of charities as a vehicle for larger political motives.‚Äù

Although numerous anti-terrorism laws already restrict nonprofits‚Äîlike other organizations‚Äîfrom providing funding to foreign terrorist organizations, making the proposed legislation ‚Äúredundant and unnecessary,‚Äù according to the Charity & Security Network, the Senate quickly introduced a companion measure, S. 4136, after the House voted its approval.

Seth Stern, director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, explained that the legislation could provide new, more robust tools for government officials to target nonprofit news organizations. Noting that elected officials have already called for terrorism investigations of the New York Times, Reuters, CNN, and the Associated Press, Stern warned against ‚Äúpassing overbroad and unnecessary new laws‚Äù that provide government officials with ‚Äúbrand new ways to harass and silence journalists who don‚Äôt toe the line.‚Äù

With multiple ongoing crises and an increasingly unstable world, the United States needs journalists who refuse to toe the line more than ever. The fundamental missions of journalism are to hold the powerful to account and to give the public the information required to be citizens of a democracy. These increasingly bold attacks on the media threaten to undermine those missions and turn our press into megaphones for government and corporate elites eager to escape journalistic scrutiny and public accountability.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.7598053216934204,neutral,0.8034482598304749,Anti-ban

TikTok Shop saw more than $100 million in sales on Black Friday, as the social media app's bet on live shopping in the US appears to be paying off.

What To Know: TikTok launched its Shop e-commerce platform in the fall of 2023 and has been pushing its creators and sellers to adopt the live shopping format which drives billions in sales in other markets, like China.

‚ÄúWe want people to discover new products,‚Äù Nico Le Bourgeois, TikTok Shop‚Äôs head of US operations, told Business Insider in late October.

‚ÄúTo be surprised. To feel like shopping can be different. And as a part of that, if we can have many customers shop in live and realize that this is really cool, I think we will have done a good job.‚Äù

U.S. shoppers participated in more than 30,000 live shopping streams on Friday alone. Home goods, fashion and beauty products are among the most popular categories.

Canvas Beauty, a seller of hair-care products on TikTok Shop, hit $1 million in sales within two hours of going live on the app, the company said.

Sellers are joining TikTok Shop as a way to diversify their revenue streams from other sites like Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN. CNBC reports that TikTok Shop was a hot topic at a conference for Amazon sellers in October. A session on ""how to scale your brand"" with TikTok Shop drew a full room of Amazon sellers.

""Amazon comes with a ton of competition,"" e-commerce strategist Rafay MH told the crowd at the conference. ""TikTok is the opportunity for free eyeballs and sales.""

Salesforce estimates that one in five online holiday purchases in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada will be made through online marketplaces like Shein, Temu, TikTok Shop, and AliExpress.

Potential TikTok Ban: President Joe Biden signed a bill in April that requires parent company ByteDance to sell TikTok by Jan. 19. Without a sale of TikTok, app stores and internet hosting services will be prohibited from offering the app in the U.S.

President-elect Donald Trump has flip-flopped on the issue of a TikTok ban and the future remains uncertain for the app.

Creators continue to flock to TikTok and sellers seem to be taking the looming ban of the app in stride.

""The sellers here, creators, they're building their livelihoods on TikTok,"" a TikTok spokesperson told CNBC. ""We're going to continue to show up for that. There's a huge opportunity for us.""

Music publishing has long been considered to be a slow and steady revenue stream for the industry ‚Äî the business of rounding up pennies (or, rather, micro-pennies!) for the underlying musical work copyright. But anyone who works in the field will tell you that in publishing there is plenty of drama and action behind the scenes, even if it feels, to outsiders, like the drama surrounds overly-complicated minutiae.

And at least on that first part, those outsiders might be right ‚Äî many of these topics are way too complicated, but publishers and songwriters believe every cent is worth fighting for, even if that means working within the confines of archaic systems and against Big Tech to get it done.

This year, the publishing business was marked by Hipgnosis‚Äô catalog woes, the domino effect of UMPG writers getting removed from TikTok, and the NMPA ‚Äúdeclaring war‚Äù on Spotify for cutting royalty payments by an estimated $150 million to publishers over the next year. The MLC also found itself increasingly at the center of the action. From its redesignation that kicked off the new year (and still isn‚Äôt done), to its lawsuits against Spotify and Pandora and figuring out the nine-figure adjustment in royalties owed to publishers from 2018-2022 underpayments, the collection society, which is still a relative newcomer, has become a force in the publishing sector.

And with increasing calls for PRO reform and AI threatening to alter the songwriting process, there is surely more drama ahead for publishers in 2025. Let the games begin.

2024-12-05T00:00:00Z,News,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/05/trump-tiktok-ban-national-security-risks.html,"Op-ed: With TikTok ban approved by court, it's Trump's move, and donors vs. national security

But for now, with Trump to be sworn in on Jan. 20, one day after the federal ban on TikTok is scheduled to begin, Trump's comments have intensified deep concerns about the influence that major donors will have in a second Trump administration and the extent to which private financial interests will be prioritized over national security and public welfare. In fact, it may be the first major decision made by Trump that tells us just how far his administration is willing to go in prioritizing the donor wish list.

Before Trump has the chance to weigh in as president, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a ruling on Friday upholding the new law requiring ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, to divest its U.S. operations by January 19. This case has broad implications, touching on national security concerns, constitutional questions about free speech , and the future of foreign-owned tech platforms in the U.S. The decision is not a surprise as courts generally defer to the executive and legislative branches on national security matters. The government has also given Congress clear constitutional authority to regulate foreign commerce, which supports the legislation requiring ByteDance divestment. Regardless, this case is likely headed to the Supreme Court.

Trump's transition team hasn't commented on TikTok specifically , but has said the election results give the president a mandate to follow through on the promises he made on the campaign trail, and there are some big deadlines coming up related to TikTok's fate.

""There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok,"" Trump said. ""But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.""

In an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" last March, Trump said banning TikTok would make young people ""go crazy"" and would also benefit Meta Platforms ' Facebook.

President-elect Donald Trump was early to warn about the national security dangers posed by TikTok during his first term in office, with rhetoric and policy discussions that framed the social media app within his aggressive anti-China stance. But during the 2024 campaign, Trump seemed to do an about-face .

At the center of this controversy is Jeff Yass, a major Republican donor with significant financial ties to ByteDance, TikTok's parent company. Yass, who contributed over $46 million to Republican causes during the 2024 election cycle, reportedly met with Trump in March, though the details of their conversation remain unclear. What is clear, however, is that Yass's ownership stake in ByteDance has fueled concerns in Washington about whether Trump's reversal was influenced by donor priorities rather than a pure devotion to market competition.

The Wall Street Journal recently reported that TikTok's CEO has been personally lobbying Elon Musk, who now has a close relationship with the President-Elect, on his company's behalf. Meanwhile, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last week.

The optics of a TikTok ban reversal are troubling. Imagine the backlash if a prominent Democratic donor like George Soros ‚Äî frequently vilified by Republicans ‚Äî had similarly positioned himself to influence major policy decisions tied to his personal financial interests. The accusations of corruption and undue influence, if not worse, would be deafening. Yet figures like Yass and particularly Elon Musk ‚Äî who has duct-taped himself, and his entangled financial interests to Trump's transition team and many of their personnel and policy decisions ‚Äî face little scrutiny from the same critics who level conspiracy theories against Soros.

This selective outrage underscores a systemic problem: a political system where major donors wield significant influence over policymaking, often without bipartisan expressions of concern or actions that force transparency or accountability.

TikTok's weaponized influence

Concerns about donor influence are amplified when considering the risks associated with TikTok itself. The app's meteoric rise has sparked bipartisan alarm over its ties to the Chinese government. Lawmakers and intelligence officials have consistently warned about its potential for data harvesting, espionage, and propaganda. These concerns are not abstract. During the last congressional push to ban TikTok, the app demonstrated its ability to weaponize its platform by rapidly mobilizing its user base to flood lawmakers with calls and emails opposing the ban.

This real-time demonstration of TikTok's ability to influence public sentiment, amplify social narratives, and pressure lawmakers underscores its unparalleled capacity as a tool for shaping public policy and national opinions. When coupled with ByteDance's links to the Chinese government, TikTok's potential for misuse or mischief is alarming.

Another concern around a TikTok ban reversal is the fact that there is already a law addressing TikTok: the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), enacted in April 2024 as part of Public Law 118-50. This bipartisan legislation mandates that foreign adversary-controlled applications, like TikTok, must be divested or face a U.S. ban. As federal law, PAFACA cannot simply be reversed by presidential decree. A U.S. president cannot legally bypass Congress to nullify or override an existing law. Laws passed by Congress remain binding until they are repealed or amended by Congress or struck down by the courts.

Instead of bypassing Congress or undermining existing law, any changes to TikTok's status should be addressed through the framework that PAFACA provides. Such a transparent process would ensure that decisions are made in public and on behalf of the public interest, not in the backrooms at Mar-a-Lago. With Republicans controlling both the House and Senate during the newly elected Congress, they have the power to amend or repeal PAFACA. However, doing so would require navigating a highly involved legislative process that would inevitably bring more scrutiny to Yass.

Trump's options

Given Trump's dominance of the federal courts at the highest level, he could use this route, but short of the courts, the president's authority in this context is limited. Any Trump effort to unilaterally overturn a TikTok ban as president would be difficult to execute based on how the system is supposed to work.

Two options Trump would have are enforcement discretion and executive orders. The president has considerable discretion in how federal laws are enforced. For instance, executive agencies might prioritize certain aspects of a law over others, effectively scaling down enforcement in particular areas. While executive orders cannot override existing laws, they can guide how the executive branch implements them, potentially narrowing their scope. Presidents have historically used enforcement discretion to achieve policy objectives without openly violating the law.

But addressing TikTok through the existing legal framework already established by PAFACA would allow for the consideration of balanced alternatives, such as requiring stricter data security measures, local data storage, or divestiture that places TikTok's operations under U.S. ownership. These options could protect users' access to the app while addressing legitimate security risks.

Many of these alternatives have been explored in public discussions and through proposals like ""Project Texas,"" and some have found their way into law. They have also been subject to criticism and challenges, largely about insufficient follow-through or the perception that these efforts are not thorough, would never be agreed to by the Chinese government, or are just incomplete or inadequate to address security concerns. But consideration of these remedies should continue ‚Äî to date, the execution has been nonexistent rather than the proposals being outright failures.

Republicans and Democrats sank ungodly amounts of money into creating content for TikTok this election year, but there‚Äôs a chance the app might not be around in the US come next cycle. Or even president-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration in January.

Quickly, a refresher: President Joe Biden signed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act in April, creating the state of affairs we find ourselves in today. The law put in place a system that would ban TikTok if the app‚Äôs parent company, Bytedance, didn‚Äôt sell to a US-based owner by January 19, 2025. Once that deadline rolls around, the president can decide to extend it an additional 90 days. We‚Äôre supposed to find out by tomorrow if a federal appeals court will uphold the law requiring Bytedance to sell off its stake.

Soon, we‚Äôll know whether the court will strike down the ban bill or if TikTok‚Äôs fate is left in the Trump administration‚Äôs hands.

Right now, two things stand in the way of this ban going into effect. First, the deadline. And second, a lawsuit. Shortly after the bill became law, TikTok sued the US government for violating the free speech protections of the company and its users by, effectively, banning the app. That‚Äôs the decision we‚Äôre waiting on this week.

There are a few different outcomes that could play out. The court could agree with TikTok‚Äôs arguments and strike down the law on First Amendment grounds. If that were to happen, TikTok would be safe unless the Justice Department decides to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court or the full DC circuit. Even if the feds appealed, it could take months or years before the justices take up the case, leaving us in an even lengthier limbo.

The court could also uphold the law, setting TikTok up for an outright ban. But if the court sides with the Justice Department, the incoming Trump administration may still find a way to keep the app around.

In September, Trump posted to Truth Social, saying ‚ÄúFOR ALL OF THOSE THAT WANT TO SAVE TIK TOK IN AMERICA, VOTE TRUMP!‚Äù (caps his, not mine). ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big star on TikTok,‚Äù he said in the attached video.

covers politics Vox. She first joined Vox in 2019, and her work has also appeared in Politico, Washington Monthly, and the New Republic.

A federal appeals court ruled that a congressional ban on TikTok can go into effect in the next few weeks. That‚Äôs if the incoming Trump administration doesn‚Äôt decide to upend the court‚Äôs decision.

TikTok debuted in the US in 2017 as a platform for short-form videos and became the most downloaded app in the world during the pandemic, a hub for creatives, activists, politicians, and more. However, as its influence grew, so did concerns that the app, owned by a Chinese company, could endanger American interests. That led to a bipartisan effort to force it to cut its ties with China or ban it.

The ban, which would drop TikTok from US app stores if its owner ByteDance does not divest by January 19, passed and was signed by President Joe Biden in April. TikTok and some of its content creators swiftly challenged the law in court, arguing that it violates the free speech rights of its more than 150 million American users. The Department of Justice has countered that the app, given its connection to a foreign adversary, must be banned for national security reasons. On Friday, judges on the DC Circuit court sided with the DOJ.

TikTok and the DOJ asked the DC Circuit to issue a ruling in the case by December 6, and the court delivered. But that won‚Äôt necessarily resolve the matter of a ban once and for all. There is likely to be a lengthy appeal at the US Supreme Court, and the incoming Trump administration could reverse course on the government‚Äôs TikTok policy.

President-elect Donald Trump has had a fickle relationship with TikTok. His Cabinet picks are also divided on how to handle the platform. That leaves TikTok‚Äôs future uncertain, regardless of the final outcome of legal challenges to a ban.

How we got here

A TikTok ban has been in the works since the first Trump administration. Lawmakers have argued for years that the Chinese government is using the app to spy on Americans by collecting their personal data and to spread propaganda that could be used to influence US elections.

Trump, ever the anti-China hawk, tried to ban the platform unilaterally via executive order in 2020. But the order faced swift legal challenges that were never resolved before Biden came into office and rescinded it, instead helping craft legislation to ban it.

When the bill came before Congress in March, ByteDance urged its users to call their representatives in protest. Teens and older people alike reportedly pleaded with congressional staff, saying they spend all day on the app. Creators posted on TikTok urging their followers to do the same. Some offices decided to temporarily shut down their phone lines as a result, which meant that they couldn‚Äôt field calls from their constituents about other issues either.

Lawmakers in both parties didn‚Äôt take kindly to the impromptu lobbying frenzy. Some characterized it as confirmation of their fears that the Chinese-owned app ‚Äî which was already banned on government devices ‚Äî is brainwashing America. The overrun phone lines were merely ‚Äúmaking the case‚Äù for the bill, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) wrote on X.

When the bill passed, ByteDance refused to sell TikTok, despite the fact that the company likely could have found a US buyer. Former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was among those publicly angling to purchase the app.

Instead, TikTok challenged the law in court, arguing that it violated American users‚Äô free speech rights under the First Amendment of the US Constitution. It also said that it would not be possible for ByteDance to divest within the 270-day period specified by the law due to technological challenges and the fact that the sale would have to include TikTok‚Äôs algorithm ‚Äî something the Chinese government would not allow it to sell.

‚ÄúFor the first time in history, Congress has enacted a law that subjects a single, named speech platform to a permanent, nationwide ban, and bars every American from participating in a unique online community with more than one billion people worldwide,‚Äù the company said in legal filings.

Legal experts say Congress likely doesn‚Äôt have the power to outright ban TikTok or any social media platform under the First Amendment unless it can prove that it poses legitimate and serious privacy and national security concerns that can‚Äôt be addressed by any other means. The question in the case before the DC Circuit is whether the government could have, in fact, addressed its national security concerns by other means and whether this ban actually does so. TikTok argues that the government could have found less restrictive ways to address its concerns and that the ban does not resolve them.

The government‚Äôs national security arguments in the lawsuit are redacted in legal filings. But reports have suggested that both the Chinese government and TikTok employees have abused the app‚Äôs user data. A former employee of ByteDance has alleged in court that the government accessed user data on a widespread basis for political purposes during the 2018 protests in Hong Kong. And last December, ByteDance acknowledged it had fired four employees who accessed the data of two journalists while trying to track down an internal leaker.

However, civil society groups have argued that a ban won‚Äôt address concerns about data privacy. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Democracy and Technology wrote in a letter to federal lawmakers that the Chinese government can still access Americans‚Äô data in other ways. For instance, it could just as well buy Americans‚Äô data on a legitimate open market, where the sale of that data remains unrestricted.

Nevertheless, the DC Circuit appeared to reject TikTok‚Äôs points in its decision. In the majority opinion, Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote, ‚ÄúThe First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States. Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary‚Äôs ability to gather data on people in the United States.‚Äù

The court seemed to be leaning in this direction during oral arguments in the case. It noted that the US already bans foreign ownership of broadcasting licenses, asking why a ban on TikTok is substantially different. While acknowledging weighty free speech concerns with a ban, the court also questioned TikTok‚Äôs assertion that those rights would outweigh all else, to the point that the US could not ban the app even if at war with the country controlling it.

Now that the court‚Äôs upheld the ban, an appeal to the Supreme Court is likely. Since banning TikTok is an issue that cuts across party lines, it‚Äôs not clear how the conservative majority would rule. Trump‚Äôs return to the White House may also introduce uncertainty into the implementation of the ban, even if it survives legal challenges.

What a Trump presidency means for the future of TikTok

Despite previously seeking to ban TikTok, Trump has since warmed to the platform, on which he now has 14.6 million followers, and he has vowed to save it.

It‚Äôs unclear what exactly brought about his reversal. He‚Äôs said that banning TikTok would only benefit Meta, and he may be out for revenge against the company, which blocked him from Instagram and Facebook for two years following the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol.

‚ÄúWithout TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people,‚Äù Trump told CNBC in March.

Another factor could be the influence of one of Trump‚Äôs billionaire megadonors. Jeff Yass‚Äôs investment firm Susquehanna reportedly owns 15 percent of TikTok‚Äôs parent company, a stake worth about $40 billion, according to the Financial Times. As of May, Yass had contributed more than any other individual donor to Republican candidates.

However, it‚Äôs not clear if Trump will keep his word to salvage TikTok given that he is surrounding himself with people who vehemently oppose the app. That includes his pick for secretary of state, Sen. Marco Rubio, and for Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr. Carr wrote in Project 2025 (the policy manifesto by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank) that TikTok is part of a Chinese ‚Äúforeign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.‚Äù

On the other hand, Trump has also nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for health secretary and former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence. Both have substantial followings on TikTok and oppose a ban.

Trump may have several options if he does decide to oppose the TikTok ban. The language of the ban is ‚Äúbroad and invests the president with quite a bit of discretion in how he chooses to enforce the ban,‚Äù George Wang, a staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, told Vox. That includes determining whether ByteDance has engaged in a ‚Äúqualified divestiture‚Äù from TikTok that would save it from a ban.

‚ÄúIt could grant the president some leeway to decline to enforce the ban if TikTok or ByteDance comes to some sufficient solution,‚Äù Wang said.

Alternatively, Trump may be able to influence the kinds of arguments that the DOJ would make to defend the ban (or not) before the Supreme Court if the case is appealed.

He might also be able to negotiate with Chinese officials to achieve a sale of TikTok to a US buyer in compliance with the law. James Lewis, director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told NPR that, based on his conversations with such officials, they may be more open to a sale if Trump backs down somewhat on his tariff threats against China.

But Wang said the best outcome would be a more permanent solution that protects Americans‚Äô First Amendment rights, he said.

‚ÄúTrump might decide not to enforce the TikTok ban when he first takes office in January, but he could also change his mind at any point,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd so, while I think maybe some of these enforcement and executive branch solutions might be good temporarily, I‚Äôm still really hoping that the courts declare the law unconstitutional or Congress decides to repeal it.‚Äù",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.1695412397384643,neutral,0.6064083576202393,Anti-ban

A federal appeals court panel on Friday unanimously upheld a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in a few short months, handing a resounding defeat to the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied TikTok‚Äôs petition to overturn the law ‚Äî which requires TikTok to break ties with its China-based parent company ByteDance or be banned by mid-January ‚Äî and rebuffed the company‚Äôs challenge of the statute, which it argued had ran afoul of the First Amendment.

‚ÄúThe First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,‚Äù said the court‚Äôs opinion, which was written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg. ‚ÄúHere the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary‚Äôs ability to gather data on people in the United States.‚Äù

TikTok and ByteDance ‚Äî another plaintiff in the lawsuit ‚Äî are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, though its unclear whether the court will take up the case.

‚ÄúThe Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans‚Äô right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,‚Äù TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement.

‚ÄúUnfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people,‚Äù Hughes said. Unless stopped, he argued the statute ‚Äúwill silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.‚Äù

Though the case is squarely in the court system, its also possible the two companies might be thrown some sort of a lifeline by President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the presidential campaign that he is now against such action.

The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, was the culmination of a years-long saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat due to its connections to China.

The U.S. has said it‚Äôs concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that‚Äôs difficult to detect ‚Äî a concern mirrored by the European Union on Friday as it scrutinizes the video-sharing app‚Äôs role in the Romanian elections.

TikTok, which sued the government over the law in May, has long denied it could be used by Beijing to spy on or manipulate Americans. Its attorneys have accurately pointed out that the U.S. hasn‚Äôt provided evidence to show that the company handed over user data to the Chinese government, or manipulated content for Beijing‚Äôs benefit in the U.S. They have also argued the law is predicated on future risks, which the Department of Justice has emphasized pointing in part to unspecified action it claims the two companies have taken in the past due to demands from the Chinese government.

Friday‚Äôs ruling came after the appeals court panel, composed of two Republican and one Democrat appointed judges, heard oral arguments in September.

In the hearing, which lasted more than two hours, the panel appeared to grapple with how TikTok‚Äôs foreign ownership affects its rights under the Constitution and how far the government could go to curtail potential influence from abroad on a foreign-owned platform. On Friday, all three of them denied TikTok‚Äôs petition.

In the court‚Äôs ruling, Ginsburg, a Republican appointee, rejected TikTok‚Äôs main legal arguments against the law, including that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. He also said the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to ‚Äúsuppress content or require a certain mix of content‚Äù on TikTok.

‚ÄúContent on the platform could in principle remain unchanged after divestiture, and people in the United States would remain free to read and share as much PRC propaganda (or any other content) as they desire on TikTok or any other platform of their choosing,‚Äù Ginsburg wrote, using the abbreviation for the People‚Äôs Republic of China.

Judge Sri Srinivasan, the chief judge on the court, issued a concurring opinion.

TikTok‚Äôs lawsuit was consolidated with a second legal challenge brought by several content creators - for which the company is covering legal costs - as well as a third one filed on behalf of conservative creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. Other organizations, including the Knight First Amendment Institute, had also filed amicus briefs supporting TikTok.

‚ÄúThis is a deeply misguided ruling that reads important First Amendment precedents too narrowly and gives the government sweeping power to restrict Americans‚Äô access to information, ideas, and media from abroad,‚Äù said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the organization. ‚ÄúWe hope that the appeals court‚Äôs ruling won‚Äôt be the last word.‚Äù

Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers who had pushed for the legislation celebrated the court‚Äôs ruling.

‚ÄúI am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,‚Äù said Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China.

Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who co-authored the law, said ‚Äúit‚Äôs time for ByteDance to accept‚Äù the law.

To assuage concerns about the company‚Äôs owners, TikTok says it has invested more than $2 billion to bolster protections around U.S. user data.

The company has also argued the government‚Äôs broader concerns could have been resolved in a draft agreement it provided the Biden administration more than two years ago during talks between the two sides. It has blamed the government for walking away from further negotiations on the agreement, which the Justice Department argues is insufficient.

Attorneys for the two companies have claimed it‚Äôs impossible to divest the platform commercially and technologically. They also say any sale of TikTok without the coveted algorithm - the platform‚Äôs secret sauce that Chinese authorities would likely block under any divesture plan - would turn the U.S. version of TikTok into an island disconnected from other global content.

Still, some investors, including Trump‚Äôs former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in purchasing the platform. Both men said earlier this year that they were launching a consortium to purchase TikTok‚Äôs U.S. business.

This week, a spokesperson for McCourt‚Äôs Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said unnamed participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.2928586006164551,neutral,0.3042131066322326,Anti-ban

‚ÄúToday‚Äôs decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to collect sensitive information about millions of Americans, to covertly manipulate the content delivered to American audiences, and to undermine our national security,‚Äù Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday.

The U.S. has said it‚Äôs concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that‚Äôs difficult to detect.

To assuage concerns about the company‚Äôs owners, TikTok says it has invested more than $2 billion to bolster protections around U.S. user data.

The company has also argued the government‚Äôs broader concerns could have been resolved in a draft agreement it provided the Biden administration more than two years ago during talks between the two sides. It has blamed the government for walking away from further negotiations on the agreement, which the Justice Department argues is insufficient.

Attorneys for the two companies have claimed it‚Äôs impossible to divest the platform commercially and technologically. They also say any sale of TikTok without the coveted algorithm ‚Äî the platform‚Äôs secret sauce that Chinese authorities would likely block under any divesture plan ‚Äî would turn the U.S. version of TikTok into an island disconnected from other global content.

Still, some investors, including Trump‚Äôs former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in purchasing the platform. Both men said earlier this year that they were launching a consortium to purchase TikTok‚Äôs U.S. business.

This week, a spokesperson for McCourt‚Äôs Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said unnamed participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.2163500785827636,neutral,0.5561690926551819,Anti-ban

U.S Court of Appeals has upheld a law that would force the sale of TikTok

A panel of three judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has upheld a federal law Congress passed in April mandating that TikTok will be banned in the United States unless its sold.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

A federal appeals court in Washington has upheld a law that could ban TikTok starting next month. The court ruled that TikTok poses a real national security threat because the app's owner, ByteDance, is based in China. But President elect Donald Trump has promised to save TikTok - a reversal of his previous position. We're joined now by NPR's Bobby Allyn to help us understand what this all means for the future of TikTok. Hi, Bobby.

BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey. What's up, Ailsa?

CHANG: Hey. OK, so how did the court justify its ruling here?

ALLYN: Yeah. This case was testing two things - free speech and national security. On the one hand, the Justice Department argued that the only way to protect national security is to ban TikTok unless it breaks away from its China-based parent company. On the other hand, TikTok said the government shutting down a social media platform used by half of America is a First Amendment violation. Now, the court, Ailsa, ruled in kind of an interesting way. It combined the two ideas. So the court agreed with the Justice Department by upholding this TikTok ban law but based it on free-speech grounds. The court said, by preventing China from tinkering with the algorithm, the law, quote, ""vindicates the values that undergird the First Amendment.""

CHANG: Huh.

ALLYN: In other words, the court says it is both protecting national security and preventing free speech manipulation by China in allowing TikTok to be banned here.

CHANG: Clever, clever. OK, well, now that the TikTok ban law has been upheld, is TikTok actually going to be banned?

ALLYN: Right. Well, we just don't know. Under the law, starting on January 19, Apple and Google must kick TikTok out of app stores, and web-hosting companies will not be allowed to host TikTok. Now, this isn't like there's some giant, you know, ban TikTok button that's going to be pushed, and then everything will turn off, right? Once TikTok is booted from app stores, software updates won't reach the app, and it'll get slow and glitchy, and eventually it just won't be usable at all. But the day the law goes into effect - you know, the following day, January 20 - Trump will be sworn into office.

CHANG: Yeah.

ALLYN: And Trump says he will find a way to rescue the app, which can take on many forms, but Trump has a lot of power in this situation.

CHANG: OK, so what options does Trump have?

ALLYN: So there are at least three options here. First, Trump could extend the ban deadline to buy some time. That's kind of a temporary fix. Secondly, he could instruct his administration not to enforce the law. And finally, Trump could try to orchestrate some kind of deal for TikTok to be purchased - you know, using this ban law as leverage. This would require the Chinese government to sign off, but analysts I've been talking to, who are in touch with Chinese regulators, say Beijing is warming up to the idea of having ByteDance sell TikTok's U.S. operation if it means some trade concessions.

CHANG: Huh.

ALLYN: You know, they could get something out of this. Remember, Trump has promised really harsh tariffs on Chinese imports.

CHANG: Exactly. Meanwhile, I imagine the court battle is not over, right?

ALLYN: It is far from over. TikTok said in a statement that they plan to take it to the Supreme Court, but it is, of course, not guaranteed that the high court will review the decision. TikTok, though - you know, they say they are very hopeful the Supreme Court will step in and overturn the law.

CHANG: OK. Well, in the meantime, how safe should we all feel while we are using TikTok? What do you think?

ALLYN: Yeah, you know, it really depends, Ailsa, on how you see it, right? TikTok has long said its U.S. operations, which are based in Los Angeles, are completely walled off from China. But TikTok and its China-based parent company, ByteDance, do share staff. They share an algorithm, and data flows between LA and China, right? So that is just the reality. There are no public examples of the Chinese government using TikTok to collect data or push pro-China narratives or to push propaganda, but U.S. officials and the Justice Department say the possibility alone of that happening is just too great a risk, and the DOJ says TikTok needs to be banned.

CHANG: That is NPR's Bobby Allyn. Thank you, Bobby.

ALLYN: Hey, thanks, Ailsa.

A nationwide TikTok ban, including in Wisconsin, looks poised to kick in soon unless the video-sharing app's parent company sells off the platform.

On Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit voted to deny the review of three petitions for relief from TikTok and ByteDance, the platform's parent company. The court found the petitions, which aimed to reverse the impending ban, unconstitutional.

Here's what to know about the legislation banning TikTok, including what it means for Wisconsin.

Will TikTok be banned in Wisconsin?

In April, Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed a bill that would make TikTok illegal to download everywhere in the U.S., including Wisconsin, starting Jan. 19, 2025 ‚Äî unless ByteDance sells the platform to another company.

If ByteDance doesn't sell the app, it will no longer be possible to download TikTok from Apple's App Store or Google Play, or to access the app on a U.S. internet browser.

People in the U.S. who already have the TikTok app can still use it, but they would not have access to future software updates if TikTok is no longer in app stores.

Why is TikTok considered a national security threat?

Proponents of the TikTok ban are primarily concerned with ByteDance, a Chinese-owned company based in Beijing, having access to U.S. users' data. More than 170 million Americans use TikTok.

In particular, both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have said the Chinese government could potentially spy on Americans or spread propaganda through the app. The ban received overwhelming bipartisan support, with the Senate passing it 79-18 and the House, 352-65.

In 2022, Congress and Biden also approved a bill banning TikTok on U.S. government devices over similar national security concerns.

Which Wisconsin politicians support banning TikTok?

Wisconsin's congressional delegation has been largely supportive of the TikTok ban.

In fact, Wisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher was an author of the bill and has been a longtime advocate of banning the app.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt take the chance of having a dominant news platform in America controlled or owned by a company that is beholden to the Chinese Communist Party, our foremost adversary,‚Äù Gallagher, a Green Bay Republican, said earlier this year.

Gallagher left Congress in April and later took a job leading the defense business for data analytics and security firm Palantir.

Of Wisconsin's eight-member House delegation, the only representatives to vote against the TikTok ban were Democratic Reps. Mark Pocan and Gwen Moore.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs probably valid concerns when it comes to social media disinformation and all the rest,‚Äù Pocan told the Journal Sentinel in March. ‚ÄúBut to say that a single platform is the problem largely because it‚Äôs Chinese-owned honestly, I think, borders more on xenophobia than addressing that core issue.‚Äù

On the Senate side, the ban passed as part of a sweeping, $95 billion foreign aid package that provided funds to Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies. Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin voted in favor of the package, while Republican Sen. Ron Johnson voted against.

How has TikTok responded to the ban?

TikTok and ByteDance have routinely denied claims that the app poses a national security threat to the U.S., according to USA TODAY.

When arguing against the law to the federal appeals court earlier this year, TikTok's outside lawyer Andrew Pincus said banning TikTok would violate U.S. users' free speech rights, USA TODAY reported.

""The law before this court is unprecedented, and its effect would be staggering,"" Pincus said. ""For the first time in history, Congress has expressly targeted a specific U.S. speaker, banning its speech and the speech of 170 million Americans.""

In its petitions to the court, ByteDance has also claimed selling the platform is ""not possible,"" commercially, technologically or legally.

What could the U.S. Supreme Court and incoming President Donald Trump do about the ban?

The two companies have indicated they will appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The court has not said if it would hear the case, the Associated Press reported.

It's also unclear how the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump could change the situation. In his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok but said in his most recent campaign that he was against a ban.

Bezos Advocates for Growth Over Cuts

At the New York Times DealBook Summit, Amazon.com Inc. founder Bezos emphasized the importance of economic growth in tackling national debt. He suggested that the U.S. should aim for a GDP growth rate of 3-5% annually, rather than focusing solely on reducing debt. Bezos stated, ‚ÄúWe need a growth orientation in this country. This is the most important thing‚Ä¶ a growth mindset.‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs Tariff Threats and BRICS

Economists at Goldman Sachs caution that such tariffs could lead to increased consumer prices and slower growth.

Tiktok has restored service in the US after President Trump signed an executive order to delay a ban.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

President Donald Trump's executive order delaying the TikTok ban taking effect gives its owner, ByteDance, a 75-day reprieve ‚Äî but the app's future is far from certain.

While signing it, Trump said that if he was able to halt the ban, the US should own half of TikTok. He also said he would be open to Elon Musk or Larry Ellison buying the app.

The Supreme Court originally upheld the divest-or-ban law on Friday, with the justices writing in their opinion that it did not violate the First Amendment rights of TikTok or its users. At the time, the ruling set a deadline of January 19 for TikTok to sell its US operations to an American entity or face a ban from US app stores.

TikTok has said the ban was ""conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed, and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people.""

Meanwhile, a slew of ultrawealthy investors have also expressed interest in buying the social media platform.

Big-name potential buyers, from Kevin O'Leary of ""Shark Tank"" to former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, have said for months that they are prepared to step in.

YouTuber MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, said this week he was also interested in buying TikTok, though it's unclear how serious his interest is.

Here's what those who've said publicly that they want to buy TikTok would do with the platform if they acquired the app.

Representatives for TikTok did not respond to a request for comment from BI.

Kevin O'Leary

In March, the ""Shark Tank"" mogul told CNBC he wanted to assemble a syndicate of investors to purchase the platform for about $20 to $30 billion ‚Äî a fraction of its $220 billion valuation in its last funding round.

""It's the largest entertainment and business network in America as it stands today, so it's of great interest and great value,"" he told the outlet.

However, O'Leary said a sale likely wouldn't include TikTok's signature algorithms, so he or another purchaser would have to ""re-emulate"" the app's algorithms and act as a ""steward"" to transform the platform from ""TikTok China to TikTok U.S.A.""

Representatives for O'Leary did not respond to a request for comment from BI.

Earlier this month, O'Leary teamed up with McCourt to pursue purchasing the app.

Frank McCourt

The former Dodgers owner and former CEO of McCourt Global has turned democratizing and improving the internet into a major philanthropic focus through his Project Liberty effort. The company announced in March that McCourt had put together a bid to purchase TikTok.

McCourt, during a December 8 appearance on CBS News, said he had ""circled over $20 billion"" for the potential sale.

""We're very serious about raising whatever capital is required to buy the platform and to be clear, we're looking to move the 170 million users over to a new protocol where the individuals will own and control their identity and their data,"" McCourt said. ""We're not looking to replicate the existing version.""

The billionaire businessman has titled his TikTok purchase project ""The People's Bid.""

McCourt told CBS that the People's Bid aims to protect user privacy and move users to ""a new stack where you can't harvest without permission, so individuals will own and control their identity and their data"" to promote an internet service that respects its users ""as opposed to exploits them.""

McCourt has secured the backing of Guggenheim Securities, an investment banking firm, and Kirkland & Ellis, one of the world's largest law firms.

On January 6 ""The People's Bid"" announced O'Leary had joined their effort.

""Joining The People's Bid for TikTok is an opportunity to take action on an issue I'm deeply passionate about - protecting privacy and creating value for users,"" O'Leary said in a press release at the time.

A spokesperson for McCourt previously directed BI to a statement from the billionaire that said in part: ""We are going to rebuild TikTok and prove that it's possible to enjoy the internet without sacrificing our privacy and safety.""

MrBeast

Donaldson, whose goes by MrBeast on YouTube, where he's amassed 344 million subscribers, said in a post on X on Monday: ""Okay fine, I'll buy Tik Tok so it doesn't get banned.""

It was unclear how serious he was about buying the app, but in a follow up post on Tuesday Donaldson wrote: ""Unironically I've had so many billionaires reach out to me since I tweeted this, let's see if we can pull this off.""

In a video posted to TikTok on Wednesday, Donaldson said he had just gotten out of a meeting with ""a bunch of billionaires"" about buying the app.

""TikTok, we mean business,"" Donaldson said, adding, ""We have an offer ready for you. We want to buy the platform. America deserves TikTok. Give me a seat at the table. Let me save this platform, TikTok.""

Representatives for Donaldson did not respond to a request for comment from BI.

Representatives from Tikok and ByteDance did not respond to a request for comment from BI on Donaldson's stated interest in buying the app.

Steven Mnuchin

The former treasury secretary in March said he was putting together an investor group to try to purchase TikTok, CNBC reported.

Mnuchin didn't specify any other potential investors involved in the bid or the dollar amount they planned to offer for the social media site. In a May interview with Bloomberg Television, he said he'd replicate the app's signature algorithm to continue the service.

""My plan, if we were to purchase, it would be to rebuild the technology under US leadership, make sure that it's all disconnected from ByteDance going forward, and that it is very robust and secure,"" Mnuchin said.

Representatives for Mnuchin did not respond to a request for comment from BI.

Bobby Kotick

The Wall Street Journal reported in March that the former chief executive of Activision was considering bidding for TikTok. The outlet reported the exact amount of his proposal was unspecified but would likely be in the hundreds of billions of dollars.

The Journal reported Kotick approached OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and other possible investors during a dinner at an Allen & Co. conference, discussing a potential deal that could allow OpenAI to train its artificial intelligence models on the data gathered from the app.

A spokesperson for Kotick previously told Business Insider, ""Mr. Kotick has always believed a comprehensive reciprocal trade framework is preferable to singling out an individual company, and he still does.""

Elon Musk

A day after his inauguration at a press conference, President Donald Trump said he'd support Elon Musk or Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison in buying TikTok.

""I would be, if he wanted to buy it, yes,"" Trump said when asked by a reporter if he would be open to the Tesla CEO buying TikTok.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has not expressed interest in buying TikTok, but he wrote on X on Sunday that he has ""been against a TikTok ban for a long time"" because it ""goes against freedom of speech.""

Larry Ellison

At the same press conference ‚Äî where Trump also announced Stargate, a joint venture in AI between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank ‚Äî Trump said he'd also be open if Oracle cofounder and chairman Larry Ellison were to ""buy it too,"" in reference to TikTok.

Trump said he was considering letting a US buyer own half of the app in exchange for a permit to operate in the country. Ellison didn't seem to be opposed to the idea.

""It sounds like a good deal to me, Mr. President,"" Ellison said.

Oracle, a traditional business-to-business software company previously tried to buy TikTok in 2020. The deal would have helped Oracle break into the market for cloud services dominated by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google at the time.

Oracle is currently a service provider for TikTok's US operations.

Other possible investors

Other big names have previously shown interest in buying TikTok, including Microsoft, which in 2020 tried and failed to acquire the platform when, during his first administration in August 2020, President Donald Trump, citing concerns about ByteDance's ties to Beijing, issued executive orders forcing ByteDance to sell its TikTok US operations to an American company.

Walmart and Oracle also assembled a bid to buy TikTok in 2020, but TikTok ultimately defeated Trump's orders in court and the acquisition plans did not materialize.

The companies have not publicly said whether they would make another offer now. Walmart, Oracle, and Microsoft representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.2078856229782104,neutral,0.9411978125572203,Anti-ban

The ban is set to go into effect next month unless TikTok finds a new owner.

TikTok on Monday requested the emergency pause of a law set to ban the popular social media app next month.

A temporary lifting of the measure would afford the Supreme Court time to determine whether it should review the law, the company said in a court filing.

The filling arrives days after TikTok -- which boasts more than 170 million U.S. users -- lost a challenge against the measure in a federal appeals court.

A pause of the law would afford the Supreme Court time to determine whether it should ‚Äúreview this exceptionally important case,‚Äù TikTok said in the court filing on Monday.

Attorneys for the Department of Justice on Monday urged the federal court to reject TikTok's request for a temporary injunction. The DOJ said it plans to file a formal motion opposing TikTok's request as soon as Wednesday, but the government agency urged the court to reject TikTok's request even before then.

""The Court is familiar with the relevant facts and law and has definitively rejected petitioners‚Äô constitutional claims in a thorough decision that recognizes the critical national-security interests underlying the Act,"" the DOJ's attorneys said.

The law would impose a nationwide ban of TikTok on Jan. 19, 2025, unless the company finds a different owner.

The ban would take effect one day before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has signaled that he would seek to reverse a possible ban.

The legal pause would also allow the Trump administration an opportunity to decide its approach to TikTok, the company‚Äôs legal filing said.

TikTok had challenged the law on First Amendment grounds, arguing that a potential ban would deny American users access to a popular venue for public expression. Attorneys for the company also disputed claims that the app poses a national security risk.

In a ruling on Friday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected TikTok‚Äôs bid to overturn the law.

The federal court found merit in security concerns about potential data collection or content manipulation undertaken by the Chinese government.

Each of those two concerns ""constitutes an independently compelling national security interest,"" the court opinion said. The court cited previous instances in which the Chinese government had pursued data, noting the government's use of relationships with Chinese-owned businesses.

The China-based app has faced growing scrutiny from government officials over fears that user data could fall into the possession of the Chinese government and the app could be weaponized by China to spread misinformation. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, has denied those claims.

There is little evidence that TikTok has shared U.S. user data with the Chinese government or that the Chinese government has asked the app to do so, cybersecurity experts previously told ABC News.

In a statement on Monday, TikTok urged the Supreme Court to intervene on its behalf.

""The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people.‚Äù

A federal appeals court upheld a law on Friday requiring TikTok‚Äôs Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell the app popular among U.S. kids and teens or face a ban in the United States.

The ruling brings a potential TikTok ban in the U.S. another step closer to coming to fruition, as ByteDance has until January to either sell the app or have it banned, according to the legislation.

The U.S. Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit found that the sell or ban legislation does not violate the First Amendment because China is a foreign adversary that the U.S. government is seeking to limit the communist regime‚Äôs ‚Äúability to gather data on people in the United States.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States. Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary‚Äôs ability to gather data on people in the United States,‚Äù the court wrote, according to a report by Reuters.

‚ÄúFor these reasons the petitions are denied,‚Äù the court added.

The court went on to say, ‚ÄúConsequently, TikTok‚Äôs millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication. That burden is attributable to the PRC‚Äôs hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.‚Äù

ByteDance now has until January 19 to sell the popular app or face a ban in the United States ‚Äî unless Joe Biden chooses to give the Chinese company a 90-day extension.

‚ÄúUnless TikTok executes a qualified divestiture by January 19, 2025 ‚Äî or the President grants a 90-day extension based upon progress towards a qualified divestiture ‚Äî its platform will effectively be unavailable in the United States, at least for a time,‚Äù the court said.

Oracle (ORCL) stock slid late Monday, after the database software giant reported fiscal second quarter earnings and sales that were just shy of consensus estimates. With the 47-year-old database software giant's stock up 80% on the year heading into the report, one analyst called the stock's decline following the results ""a story of expectations.""

Oracle said in a news release that it earned an adjusted $1.47 per share on sales of $14.06 billion for the November-ended quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet projected the Austin, Texas-based company would post adjusted earnings of $1.48 per share on sales of $14.12 billion. Sales increased 9% while earnings increased 9.7%.

On the stock market today, Oracle stock is down more than 5% to 180.37 in after-hours action. Shares fell by as much as 8% following the report, before recovering. Before that, Oracle stock lost a fraction to close at 190.54 in regular trading Monday.

Cloud Growth Accelerates With AI Demand

The software firm's closely-watched Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business grew revenues 52% year over year to $2.4 billion, accelerating from 45% growth in Oracle's previous quarter. Prior to the report, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote that investors were likely looking for 52% growth for the cloud infrastructure business.

Helped by AI startups renting computing power, OCI has grown quickly in recent quarters and emerged as a fourth enterprise cloud option, chasing the much-larger hyperscalers Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.

Oracle Chief Executive Safra Catz said in a news release Monday that ""record level AI demand"" powered OCI to a ""much higher growth rate than any of our hyperscale cloud infrastructure competitors.""

Catz added, ""With our remaining performance obligation (RPO) up 50% to $97 billion, we believe our already impressive growth rates will continue to climb even higher. This fiscal year, total Oracle Cloud revenue should top $25 billion.""

Oracle's overall cloud revenue increased 24% year over year to $5.9 billion. Cloud sales grew 21% in Oracle's August quarter.

Watching Guidance For Oracle Stock

Oracle is expected to provide guidance for the current quarter on a conference call with analysts shortly. Prior to Oracle's results, analysts were projecting sales of $14.6 billion for the February-ending quarter, representing 10% year-over-year growth.

Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow, who is bullish on Oracle, wrote to clients following the report that the negative response is a ""story of expectations.""

""We do not totally agree with the big negative reaction to Oracle's Q2 results,"" he added. ""Revenue growth accelerated in Q2 to roughly 9% year over year (was roughly 8% in Q1) and with that the fiscal year guidance remains intact. Guidance on the call will be important.""

Oracle Stock: 94 Composite Rating

Meanwhile, the tech giant's shares are ahead 83% overall this year, not counting Monday's late action. That puts Oracle stock on pace for its best year since 1999. Oracle stock had gained by a double-digit percentage after each of its previous three earnings reports.

Heading into the report, Oracle stock had an IBD Composite Rating of 94 out of 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. Further, the best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.

Further, Oracle's IBD Relative Strength Rating was 92 out of 99. The RS Rating means that Oracle has outperformed 92% of all stocks over the past year.

2024-12-10T00:00:00Z,News,mashable.com,https://mashable.com/article/tiktok-ban-injunction-petition,"TikTok requests emergency injunction to delay U.S. ban

As the new year draws ever closer, so too does the U.S. TikTok ban. TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have now requested an emergency injunction, attempting to stave off the looming ban after a U.S. court of appeals upheld it on Friday. If this injunction is denied, TikTok will have to shut down in the U.S. by Jan. 19.

In a petition filed to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals on Monday, TikTok asked that the U.S. ban on its video sharing platform not be enforced until the matter is addressed by the Supreme Court. Stating its intention to file an appeal, TikTok argued that it's likely the Supreme Court will opt to review and ultimately reverse Friday's decision.

SEE ALSO: Federal court ruling brings us one step closer to a TikTok ban

""[The Court of Appeals'] holding that the Act satisfies strict scrutiny is sure to attract the Supreme Court‚Äôs attention,"" wrote TikTok. ""As speech restrictions have survived strict scrutiny only in rare and narrow circumstances, the Supreme Court will want to ensure that this Court‚Äôs decision has not diluted that critical standard.""

Strict scrutiny is a legal standard which demands that laws which restrict free speech are narrowly tailored to advance a compelling governmental interest. Such laws must also be the least restrictive method of achieving this objective. TikTok has argued that the U.S. government failed this standard by allegedly passing the ban without considering less drastic alternatives.

In deciding whether to grant an injunction such as the one TikTok has requested, courts consider elements such as whether the appeal is likely to succeed, as well as if parties will suffer harm if the injunction is not granted.

TikTok's petition claimed that while the ban will cause it to suffer ""extreme and irreparable harm,"" temporarily holding off will pose no danger to the U.S. or its national security. The company further noted that Congress already delayed the ban coming into effect for 270 days, which TikTok said indicated that ""the asserted national security threat is not sufficiently imminent to forestall the completion of orderly judicial review.""

""[T]he Government‚Äôs own defense of the Act at most asserts that China 'could' engage in certain harmful conduct through TikTok, not that China is currently doing so or will soon do so,"" wrote TikTok.

TikTok has also argued that it is within the public interest to grant a temporary injunction, as it is ""one of the most popular speech platforms in America."" If the Court of Appeals denies the injunction, Americans will lose TikTok just one day before Donald Trump's presidential inauguration on Jan. 20.

""The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,"" TikTok said in a statement responding to Friday's decision. ""Unfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people. The TikTok ban, unless stopped, will silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the U.S. and around the world on January 19th, 2025.""

According to TikTok, a ban on the platform would cause small businesses to lose over $1 billion in revenue within just one month, while creators would suffer $300 million in lost earnings.

TikTok is facing a ban in the US over national security concerns

TikTok has warned this may have huge consequences for US small businesses

President-elect Trump may yet reverse the ban, although his position remains unclear

The US‚Äôs deadline on the proposed TikTok sell-off is fast approaching, and it looks like there may actually be a possibility the social media giant could disappear from US users' devices in January 2025.

As it stands, TikTok is set to be banned in the US on January 19 2025 - or its Chinese parent company will be forced to sell due to national security concerns. President-elect Trump could reverse the ban, but as his administration doesn't take office until January 20, so there is potential for a pretty disruptive gap.

TikTok insists the US does not face imminent threat of harm in regards to national security, but does point out that many US businesses would be ‚Äòirreparably harmed‚Äô by a loss of audience and advertising opportunities.

De-influenced

With a shocking 12 million full-time ‚Äòinfluencers‚Äô in the US, many of whom will use TikTok as a large source of income, there could be some massive backlash against the ban.

This could have wider reaching consequences than expected for the US economy. The platform has over 170 million users in the US, and it been estimated that small businesses and content creators could suffer huge losses if the ban is enforced,

""Estimates show that small businesses on TikTok would lose more than $1 billion in revenue and creators would suffer almost $300 million in lost earnings in just one month unless the TikTok Ban is halted,"" TikTok's spokesperson said.

Previously, Donald Trump has vowed to save the platform in order to ‚Äòpreserve competition in a market dominated by Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs Meta‚Äô, but with Elon Musk, (owner of rival social media company Twitter), by his side during the campaign trail, this may have shifted his view.

2024-12-11T00:00:00Z,News,thewrap.com,https://www.thewrap.com/tiktok-offers-cash-users-recruit-friends-us-ban/,"TikTok Offers Cash to Users to Recruit Friends Ahead of US Ban

TikTok‚Äôs not-so-secret weapon to grab new users ahead of its looming U.S. ban: money.

The popular app has started offering existing users $50 to recruit new users to TikTok, and up to an additional $350 in bonus bucks if they‚Äôre able to convince more friends to join. Some TikTok users have seen the ‚Äúlimited time offer‚Äù promo under their ‚Äúfor you‚Äù tab on the app.

Bloomberg was the first outlet to spot the cash-for-recruitment plan on Tuesday.

The promo comes as TikTok is scrambling to remain active in the States. TikTok is set to be banned from the U.S. on January 19, 2025 ‚Äî one day before president-elect Donald Trump retakes office ‚Äî unless Bytedance, its China-based parent company, divests from its American operations. The TikTok ban was initially floated during Trump‚Äôs first administration, before ultimately being passed by Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden earlier this year.

On Monday, TikTok and Bytedance filed an emergency injunction, calling for an appeals court to temporarily block the law that is set to ban the app.

The delay, TikTok argued in its filing, would ‚Äúcreate breathing room‚Äù for the U.S. Supreme Court to ‚Äúconduct an orderly review‚Äù of the law, as well as give the incoming Trump administration time to evaluate the matter. TikTok pointed to president-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs comment earlier this year that he was going to ‚Äúsave TikTok‚Äù in its filing.

TikTok, via its cash offer for existing users, may believe boosting its user count as much as possible in the weeks ahead will make it tougher to ban. The app has 170 million monthly users in the U.S., according to its Monday filing.

The chief concern U.S. lawmakers have with TikTok is that it doubles as a spyware app for the Chinese government; TikTok, according to Chinese law, is required to share user data with China‚Äôs communist government, if it is asked to.

TikTok has previously argued the ban would ‚Äútrample‚Äù the First Amendment right to free speech of its users.

Most Americans don‚Äôt seem to be too concerned with China‚Äôs government having easy access to their data, though. Only 32% of Americans are in favor of the U.S. government banning TikTok, according to a Pew Research Center survey in September of 10,678 respondents aged 18 and older. That‚Äôs down from 50% who supported a ban in March 2023 ‚Äî and TikTok‚Äôs users are even less inclined to support a ban, with 61% of U.S. users opposing it. (Among those surveyed, 51% leaned towards Democrats politically, while 46% said they were Republican-leaning.)",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.2206766605377197,neutral,0.9522000551223756,Anti-ban

TikTok and its Chinese parent company have asked the United States government to take a closer look at legislation that could ban the social media platform in Michigan and nationally.

A federal appeals court recently upheld the legislation that would ban TikTok in the U.S. if the social media app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, does not sell the platform by Jan. 19, 2025. A ban could be a severe blow to Michigan users and small businesses that rely on it, the social media app says.

Both presidents Donald Trump and Biden have targeted the company for its practices.

A report created by TikTok and Oxford Economics claims more than 165,000 businesses and 3.7 million people actively use TikTok in Michigan. The report, based on a survey of 1,050 small and midsize businesses and 7,500 TikTok users, includes 33 small businesses and 200 consumers from Michigan.

TikTok says its app contributed $150 million in federal, state and local tax revenue in the state and supported 6,700 jobs in 2023 in Michigan.

What is TikTok?

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia panel's decision defines TikTok as a ""social-media platform that lets users create, upload, and watch short video clips overlaid with text, voice-overs, and music."" The opinion notes that the platform tailors content to a user's tastes.

The opinion further notes that about 170 million people use TikTok each month in the U.S.

What does the federal legislation say?

Under HR 7521, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which President Joe Biden signed this year, if TikTok is still operated by ByteDance after Jan. 19, it will become illegal for distribution in the United States.

People won't be able to download the app from the Apple App Store or Google Play, and internet service providers will be required to make the app inaccessible on U.S. internet browsers.

Do any prominent people use the app in Michigan?

Prominent Michigan institutions and public figures are on the app including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the University of Michigan, the city of Detroit and the Detroit Lions.

Even Michigan's 13th District congressman Shri Thanedar wrote a opinion piece opposing the ban in 2023.

Did the measure have widespread in Congress?

The House bill passed 352-65. The bill passed 79-18 in the Senate.

TikTok fights back

TikTok and ByteDance have denied the national security allegations. During arguments made against the ban to the federal appeals court earlier this year, TikTok's outside lawyer Andrew Pincus addressed the ban's potential effects, USA TODAY reported.

""The law before this court is unprecedented, and its effect would be staggering,"" Pincus said. ""For the first time in history, Congress has expressly targeted a specific U.S. speaker, banning its speech and the speech of 170 million Americans.""

Over the past few months and in its petitions to the federal appeals court, ByteDance has claimed that selling the platform is ""not possible,"" commercially, technologically or legally.

In its opinion, the federal appeals court stated that is understands the ban on the social media app would have ""significant implications"" for the platform and its users.

""Unless TikTok executes a qualified divestiture by January 19, 2025 ... its platform will effectively be unavailable in the United States, at least for a time,"" the opinion states.

What happens if the ban is upheld?

TikTok most likely won‚Äôt disappear from your phone, PBS reported, even if a ban does take effect. But it would disappear from Apple and Google‚Äôs app stores, which means users won‚Äôt be able to download it.

That also would mean that TikTok wouldn‚Äôt be able to send updates, security patches and bug fixes, and over time the app would likely become unusable ‚Äî not to mention a security risk.

With a TikTok ban in the United States looking more and more likely, a new report from Pew Research on teen social media use underscores just how influential the app is among its youngest users. Not only is it one of the most-used social media services by teens, 57 percent of 13 to 17-year-olds scroll TikTok every single day, Pew reports.

The report underscores the impact a ban would have on teens. Sixty-three percent of teens report ‚Äúever‚Äù using the app, while 57 percent say they log on at least once a day. TikTok also has the highest percentage of teens reporting that they use the service ‚Äúalmost constantly,‚Äù with 16 percent. A little more than a third report checking the app ‚Äúseveral times a day.‚Äù

Pew Research Center

Pew‚Äôs report arrives as TikTok is running out of options to avoid a ban in the United States. The company lost its initial legal challenge to a law requiring that parent company ByteDance sell the app or face a total ban in the country. TikTok has asked the courts for a temporary delay of the law, which is currently scheduled to take effect January 19, while it looks to take its next appeal to the Supreme Court.

Should the ban actually happen, Pew‚Äôs report suggests that YouTube and Instagram are best-positioned to benefit. YouTube was once again the most-used app among teens, with 90 percent of 13 to 17 year-olds saying they use the service and 73 percent reporting daily use. Meta‚Äôs Instagram, which ranked just below TikTok with 61 percent of teens, is another likely successor, though only half of teens said they check the app daily.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.2607806921005249,neutral,0.7970350384712219,Neutral

If TikTok is indeed banned or sold, analysts with Morgan Stanley see Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) and YouTube, which is owned by Google, as the most likely to benefit. Meta stock gained slightly in Thursday trades.

A federal appeals court on Friday upheld a law that requires China-based ByteDance to sell TikTok to another company by Jan. 19, or the popular short-video site will be banned. President Joe Biden signed the law in the spring, prompting the legal challenge from ByteDance.

‚Üë X This Is How A TikTok Ban Could Impact The Stock Market See All Videos NOW PLAYING This Is How A TikTok Ban Could Impact The Stock Market

ByteDance has filed for a temporary halt to the ban pending a Supreme Court review. That could delay the ban if the Supreme Court agrees to hear ByteDance's challenge. It is also not yet clear if President-elect Donald Trump will try to keep TikTok active. He takes office the day after the law is scheduled to take effect.

With ""the probability of a TikTok ban or forced sale seemingly increasing,"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a client note Thursday, it is important to size up potential implications for other companies.

Facebook And Instagram Compete With TikTok

A TikTok ban or sale could create ""significant time spent and monetization opportunity for competitors,"" the research note said.

Morgan Stanley analysts previously estimated that Americans spend 53 billion hours yearly on TikTok. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote that Meta and YouTube would be the ""largest beneficiaries"" if TikTok users direct their time elsewhere.

Meta offers a similar algorithm-driven short-video product in Reels, which is available through Meta's Facebook and Instagram. YouTube hosts YouTube Shorts.

But Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP), Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest (PINS) could also benefit, the Morgan Stanley note added.

Out of that group, Nowak added, ""we would prefer to invest in Reddit, given its growing tools set to improve engagement, retention and ad performance.""

Morgan Stanley upgraded Reddit to an overweight rating earlier this week.

Which Companies Could Benefit From Acquiring TikTok?

While the Morgan Stanley analysts made clear in the research note they have ""no knowledge of any discussions,"" they offered a couple big name companies that could benefit from buying TikTok.

Nowak said Amazon (AMZN) could ""make strategic sense"" as a TikTok buyer. TikTok runs an e-commerce business through its app and also has an advertising deal with Amazon already.

""While execution to maintain and grow TikTok's users and engagement could be challenging (although Amazon could offer product discounts, faster shipping to drive users/engagement), we believe this relationship could be a positive for Amazon and its long-term advertising and e-commerce businesses,"" Nowak wrote. ""Further, with Amazon's leading ad tools, attribution, and logistics capabilities, in this merger scenario, we see the potential for a formidable competitor to Google/Meta ad dollars.""

Similarly, Walmart (WMT) could ""leverage TikTok across its omnichannel platform and contribute to its rapidly growing advertising business,"" in the view of the Morgan Stanley analysts. Walmart announced a deal to purchase a stake in TikTok along with Oracle (ORCL) in 2020, but the deal was shelved in the transition from President Donald Trump to Biden.

Microsoft (MSFT) also expressed interest in TikTok when Trump was pushing for a sale to U.S. investors in 2020. TikTok could still be a ""strong fit,"" the Morgan Stanley note said.

Meta Stock: Three Day Winning Streak

Meanwhile, Meta stock was up a fraction at 634.25 in recent action. Shares notched another record high and have gained for three consecutive trading days.

Meta closed higher yesterday despite an outage that lasted several hours for some users of Instagram, Facebook and other Meta platforms.

Elsewhere, Reddit stock is up 1% at 167.40 in recent action. Shares of Google parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) are down a half-percent at 194.15, pulling back slightly from a strong start to the week.

Amazon stock is up is trading flat at 230.21, hovering near record highs.

The Department of Justice asked a U.S. appeals court on Wednesday to reject TikTok‚Äôs bid to temporarily block a law that could result in the platform being banned from its more than 170 million users.

The law would require TikTok's Chinese-owned parent company, ByteDance, to divest the video app by Jan.19 or be banned in the U.S.

TikTok and ByteDance called the law unconstitutional in an emergency motion on Monday and argued that a small delay wouldn't bring serious national security concerns or else the U.S. would have forced divesture from TikTok immediately instead of giving ByteDance time.

TIKTOK'S CHINA-BASED PARENT REQUIRED TO SELL PLATFORM OR BE BANNED IN US

The DOJ says the ban would ""not directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok"" for those currently using the platform, but eventually the popular short-video app would be ""unworkable.""

President Biden previously signed a bill in April requiring the sale of the platform to a company not owned or operated by Chinese entities.

He, along with other lawmakers, expressed concern that the platform could be used by the Chinese government for surveillance or to spread propaganda. ByteDance has indicated that it has no intention to sell.

TikTok has indicated it will appeal the decision.

TIKTOK SAYS US BAN IS INEVITABLE UNLESS LAW REQUIRING DIVESTMENT IS BLOCKED

""The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans‚Äô right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,"" said company spokesperson Michael Hughes. ""Unfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people. The TikTok ban, unless stopped, will silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.""

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

Biden has the ability to extend that deadline by 90 days if the company is attempting to sell. However, a move like this would put the decision on President-elect Trump, who takes office Jan. 20.

Trump stated prior to the November election he would not allow a ban on TikTok.

The Game Awards delivered. While the games I thought deserved to win did so (Astro Bot! Balatro! Metaphor!), we got some wildcard trailers, like an entirely new game from Last of Us studio Naughty Dog. Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet takes place thousands of years in the future, and it stars bounty hunter Jordan A. Mun, played by Chilling Adventures of Sabrina actor Tati Gabrielle. Note: This is the first game from Naughty Dog since 2005 that isn‚Äôt Uncharted or Last of Us .

There was also, many years on, another Witcher game. Witcher 4 will feature Ciri kicking magical ass, but there‚Äôs no gameplay footage yet. Elsewhere, Virtua Fighter is getting a revival (part of Sega‚Äôs push to mine and relaunch its biggest hits) and a new brawler game from the makers of the Like A Dragon series.

Capcom too taps its gaming past, reviving the wolf god Okami and its magical ink strokes nearly two decades after the original, with the original game‚Äôs director, Hideki Kamiya, still at the helm.

And we have a new co-op game from the studio behind It Takes Two. Split Fiction is a co-op adventure where players leap between sci-fi and fantasy worlds. There is also a new sci-fi game from the creator of The Last Guardian, an Elden Ring co-op spin-off and, well, read on for even more.

YouTube and Instagram are likely to benefit the most.

With a TikTok ban in the United States looking more and more likely, a new report from Pew Research on teen social media use underscores just how influential the app is among its youngest users. It‚Äôs one of the most-used social media services by teens, with 57 percent of 13- to 17-year-olds scrolling TikTok every single day, according to the report.

TikTok is running out of options to avoid the ban in the United States. The company lost its initial legal challenge to a law requiring parent company ByteDance to sell the app or face a total ban in the country. TikTok has asked the courts for a temporary delay to the law, which is currently scheduled to take effect January 19.

Adobe has a new experimental tool for removing window reflections from photos. Originally announced at Adobe Max 2023 as Project See Through, the Reflection Removal tool is now available to preview in Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Bridge if you‚Äôre a Creative Cloud subscriber. The tool uses AI to isolate two separate images: the reflection and whatever is on the other side of the window or reflective material. Adobe says the Reflection Removal tool can‚Äôt handle ‚Äúreflections from windows that are small or far away‚Äù or reflections of ‚Äúwine glasses, car bodies or clouds reflected in a lake.‚Äù

Despite a new federal appeals court ruling upholding legislation that threatens to ban TikTok next year, a ban on the social media app is actually less likely now than ever. That is because key leaders of the Republican Party are increasingly falling in line with President-elect Trump‚Äôs support for the app and softening their own positions on how to address its future.

Beyond the obvious First Amendment concerns with stifling a social media platform that gives voice to more than 170 million American users, these politicians all recognize that the app is a critical political tool for reaching young and diverse voters, as Trump demonstrated so ably during his campaign. Finally putting this TikTok ban threat in the rearview mirror is both good policy and good politics.

Leading Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and Trump‚Äôs designated new Secretary of State, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who both voted for the ban legislation, have indicated that Republicans are shifting towards supporting Trump‚Äôs efforts to save TikTok. Communications Daily last month reported that despite his previous concerns, Rubio now says he‚Äôs deferring to the president-elect on the matter, stating, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the president, so if that‚Äôs what he wants to do, he‚Ä¶has the power to do it.‚Äù

Jordan was similarly quoted as saying, ‚ÄúThat was a tough vote either way, so I understand that if the president, the commander in chief, if he thinks that [a reversal] makes sense, then I think that would be fine.‚Äù Jordan went on to express his own First Amendment concerns with banning the app and concluded: ‚ÄúIf he wants to change it, I‚Äôve got no problem with that.‚Äù

The move to save TikTok is, in part, a recognition of the power of the app to reach otherwise difficult-to-reach populations who no longer get their news and information from traditional outlets. A recent study by the Pew Research Center found that just over one-half of adults (54%) say they at least sometimes get news from social media. These sites include TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, X, Reddit, and a number of other smaller social media sites. The numbers for those who regularly get news from TikTok reached 17% in 2024, up from just 3% in 2020. And about half of TikTok users (52%) regularly get news on the app, up from 22% in 2020. Any politician ignoring these trends does so at their own electoral peril.

The Trump campaign clearly demonstrated the ability of TikTok to reach new audiences. A case in point was Trump‚Äôs October campaign stop at a McDonalds in Pennsylvania. The visit became a viral moment that ‚Äúspread like wildfire on TikTok, where users were eager to watch, like, comment, and share,‚Äù as FYP News reported. The outlet noted that the TikTok post from Trump‚Äôs account showing the visit received about 40 million views, and a related account added to that total equaling over 100 million views.

A Daily Mail TikTok post showing Trump packing up fries racked up an additional 13.4 million views and a video of him serving customers at the drive-thru window collected 7.3 million views. Overall, Trump dominated Harris on TikTok, consistently receiving thousands more mentions than the Vice President throughout the campaign and helping him to control the online conversation, according to FYP News.

In September, during the heat of the campaign, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, ‚ÄúFOR ALL OF THOSE THAT WANT TO SAVE TIK TOK IN AMERICA, VOTE TRUMP!‚Äù Since then, his surrogates have made it clear that he intends to ‚Äúdeliver‚Äù on his promise.

Kellyanne Conway, a Trump veteran and advisor to the campaign, was quoted in Fox News saying that Trump ‚Äúappreciates the breadth and reach of TikTok‚Äù and ‚ÄúDemocrats are the party of bans ‚Äì gas-powered cars, menthol cigarettes, vapes, plastic straws, and TikTok.‚Äù This was an effective message, associating Democrats with largely unpopular nanny-state, intrusive policies, and associating Trump and Republicans with broader themes of personal choice, liberty, and freedom.

Frank McCourt has made a $20B bid to buy TikTok without its algorithm but told Business Insider the path toward a sale is murky since the app's parent company, ByteDance, isn't entertaining talks.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Frank McCourt, the billionaire businessman who wants to buy TikTok, told Business Insider that, despite a Friday court ruling allowing the TikTok ban's looming January 19 deadline to proceed if the company isn't sold, the path to a sale remains unclear because ""we don't know what ByteDance is selling.""

McCourt is among a small handful of investors, including former treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and the former chief executive of Activision, Bobby Kotick, who've publicly said they want to buy TikTok.

Through Project Liberty, McCourt, the former Dodger's owner and real estate developer, has put together a bid worth over $20 billion to purchase TikTok and usher in what he calls the dawn of an ""alternative, upgraded internet"" that allows users more control of their own personal data. Project Liberty includes both a for-profit entity and a nonprofit institution.

However, he said, ""It's very, very difficult to have precision"" regarding the specifics of a potential sale because ""let's be clear, we don't know what ByteDance is selling.""

ByteDance, TikTok's China-based parent company, has so far refused to entertain talks over a potential sale, McCourt said.

The company's apparent reluctance to negotiate comes despite a December 6 court ruling upholding a law that requires the app be banned from the US in January if it is not sold to a non-Chinese entity. The divest-or-ban legislation aimed to address years of concerns from critics that the influential short-form video social media app could be used as a propaganda tool for the Chinese Communist Party.

On Friday, Reuters reported that the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia denied TikTok's emergency bid to stop the ban from taking effect on January 19.

When reached by Business Insider, a TikTok spokesperson declined to comment on the terms of any potential sale, instead saying the company plans on appealing the case to the Supreme Court under the grounds that a potential ban is a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech.

""The voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world will be silenced on January 19th, 2025 unless the TikTok ban is halted,"" the TikTok spokesperson said.

Representatives for ByteDance did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Just because they're not talking about the specifics of a deal ""doesn't mean they won't eventually come to that,"" McCourt said.

And when ByteDance is ready to talk, so is he, he said.

McCourt's TikTok purchase project, which he calls "" The People's Bid "" has secured the backing of Guggenheim Securities, an investment banking firm, and Kirkland & Ellis, one of the world's largest law firms.

Rather than recreate the app's algorithm and continue business as it currently operates, McCourt hopes to acquire and use TikTok as a large-scale example of a decentralized social media app that allows users more control over their personal data.

""Imagine you're signing on to the internet. You don't have 50 passwords. You're not the IP address of a device anymore ‚Äî you're actually a person on the internet, and you have the IP address, so when you sign on the internet, you have access to all the apps that are built on the same core-level protocol,"" McCourt said. ""Now imagine all your data is yours, and you permission its use, so the apps that are built in this new world are clicking on your terms and conditions of use for your data.""

The momentum behind decentralized social media ‚Äî and the internet more broadly ‚Äî has, in recent years, been gaining steam. Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, says he is partially to blame for helping to ""centralize"" the internet and that he regrets it. He's since shifted his focus to building decentralized tech solutions.

Others, such as Chelsea Manning , the former Army intelligence analyst sentenced to 35 years in prison over her 2010 leak of classified government information, publicly promote decentralized security solutions to enhance user privacy amid concerns about cyber surveillance.

While some users are increasingly interested in decentralized social media, it is difficult for new sites to break through the centralized landscape and siphon off enough users from giants like Meta and Elon Musk's X to get to scale.

Smaller platforms often fail to achieve the positive feedback loop known as the network effect, which entices new users to join based on the positive experience of the existing user base.

If McCourt is able to acquire TikTok, the platform's existing 170 million users would come with the brand ‚Äî and he's not worried that ByteDance has reportedly shut down any talks of selling the app's signature algorithm, declaring it integral to its internal operations; he wouldn't want to buy it if it did.

""There'd probably be more buyers if the algorithm was available, or at least more buyers kicking the tires,"" McCourt said. ""But we don't want the algorithm. If someone offered TikTok to me with the algorithm, I wouldn't take it because I'm against the architecture, the design that preys on people and takes advantage of people. I think it's incongruent with our democratic principles.""",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.5583471059799194,neutral,0.8188390135765076,Anti-ban

A federal court has denied TikTok‚Äôs request for a temporary pause of a law that could result in a ban of the app next month. The ruling, which came in response to an emergency injunction filed by TikTok earlier this week, is the latest legal setback for the company as it tries to avoid a total ban of its app in the United States.

In its request for a delay in the law taking effect, TikTok indicated that it planned to appeal to the Supreme Court. The company‚Äôs lawyers also cited the possibility that President-elect Donald Trump may want to take a different approach given some of Trump‚Äôs past comments about the app. But in a brief order, a panel of three judges denied that request, writing that such a pause was ‚Äúunwarranted.‚Äù

TikTok‚Äôs future now depends on the Supreme Court, though there‚Äôs no guarantee the court will agree to hear the case. ""As we have previously stated, we plan on taking this case to the Supreme Court, which has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech,‚Äù the company said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world will be silenced on January 19th, 2025 unless the TikTok ban is halted.""",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.2292042970657348,neutral,0.4409812390804291,Anti-ban

The federal appeals court that last week rejected TikTok's attempt to overthrow its pending ban denied the company's request Friday that sought to pause the ruling and the Jan. 19 deadline for a sale.

The company, which has been forced by a federal law to sell to a new owner or be banned in the U.S., requested the emergency pause earlier in the week arguing it would afford the Supreme Court time to determine whether it should review the law.

However, the D.C. Circuit judges said that Congress made a ""deliberate choice"" to set a 270-day time frame for the sale-or-ban, ""subject to one (and only one) extension.""

""The petitioners have not identified any case in which a court, after rejecting a constitutional challenge to an Act of Congress, has enjoined the Act from going into effect while review is sought in the Supreme Court,"" the judges wrote in the unsigned order.

TikTok has not immediately commented about the order.

The Justice Department asked the court to reject TikTok's request for a temporary injunction.

""The Court is familiar with the relevant facts and law and has definitively rejected petitioners‚Äô constitutional claims in a thorough decision that recognizes the critical national-security interests underlying the Act,"" the DOJ's attorneys said.

The Justice Department did not immediately comment on the decision either.

The case would have to go to the Supreme Court if TikTok chooses to appeal, which could delay the Jan. 19 deadline.

President Joe Biden signed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which was part of a massive, $95 billion foreign aid package passed by Congress, on April 24.

As part of the act, TikTok, which has over 170 million U.S. users, is forced to sell the company from its current Chinese-based owner ByteDance.

The president and some congressional leaders have argued that the ultimatum against TikTok was necessary because of security concerns about ByteDance and its connections to the Chinese government.

ByteDance rebutted those allegations in its lawsuit, arguing there has been no tangible evidence that the app poses any security risk and filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department in May.

The law has prompted major protests from TikTok's American users who have defended the app.

President-elect Donald Trump once proposed a TikTok ban when he was in office but has changed his stance and signaled he would reverse the ban once in office. A reversal, however, would require approval from both houses of Congress.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.3478386998176574,neutral,0.8255171179771423,Neutral

THIS LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN OBSERVING OVER THE PAST DECADE. WHAT DOES THIS TELL US NOT SO MUCH ABOUT RIGHT NOW BUT ABOUT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT YEAR AS TRUMP TAKES OFFICE WITH BIG AMBITIONS FOR A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY? > > I THINK YOU NAILED IT. THIS SHOULD BE EASY AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PASS A CONTINUING RESOLUTION QUICKLY AND MOVE ON BUT WHAT THIS SUGGESTS TO ME IS THAT IT WILL BE DIFFICULT NEXT YEAR WITH A LOT OF THE TABLE. THIS CONTINUING RESOLUTION WILL GO TO MARCH 14 SO WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH HUNTING GOVERNMENT, MARCH 14 AND THEN THERE IS OF COURSE THE PRESIDENT-ELECT WHO HAS PUT FORTH A RATHER AGGRESSIVE AGENDA THAT INCLUDES PASSING A BUDGET RESOLUTION EARLY AND THAT WOULD TRIGGER A RECONCILIATION BILL AND THEN WE HAVE THE DEBT LIMIT NEXT YEAR. AND WE HAVE THE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT THAT SET UP THESE CAMPS FOR DOLLARS AND THAT IS GOING TO EXPIRE, TOO. THIS IS -- THE MARGINS ARE NOT GOING TO BE WHAT THEY ARE NOW SO THIS IS GOING TO MAKE A VERY DIFFICULT YEAR FOR LEGISLATIVE I THINK GOING FORWARD. > > WHY ADVOCATE FOR TWO DIFFERENT RECONCILIATION PACKAGES IF IT IS GOING TO BE THAT HARD TO COUNT EVERY VOTE AND GET THESE THINGS DONE, STATION SMITH HAS SAID, I KNOW HOW TO COUNT VOTES AND YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE TAX AND WHATEVER WATER AND ENERGY BILLS THEY SEEM TO WANT TO DO FIRST. WALK US THROUGH THIS LOGIC. > > WE HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE FROM THE TRUMP IS -- WHEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAME IN IN 2017 AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. WE DID NOT HAVE A BUDGET RESOLUTION IN EFFECT FOR THAT CURRENT YEAR. THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED BACK IN 2017 WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WHERE WE PASSED A BUDGET RESOLUTION. WE PASSED THAT BUDGET RESOLUTION THAT SET UP A RECONCILIATION BILL EVEN BEFORE HE WAS INAUGURATED. THE REASON WHY WE ARE AT THE MARCH IS WE ARE AT THE MARGINS NOW, I THINK SPEAKER RYAN HAD 40 VOTES TO HIS -- MAYBE ONE OR TWO IN THAT PERIOD. YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE A BUDGET RESOLUTION IN EFFECT BEFORE YOU CAN DO A RECONCILIATION BILL. THEREFORE, YOU WANT TO MAKE THAT FIRST ONE MAY BE AS CLOSE TO EASY AS POSSIBLE. TAXES IS A BIG ISSUE SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I AM NOT TAKING SIDES ON THIS DEBATE THAT WOULD SAY WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING TO SHOW THAT WE CAN TAKE -- GET SOMETHING DONE AND GET THE VOTES AND WITH THE MARGINS AS WELL AS THEY ARE, THEN I THINK THE STRATEGY IS TO DO A SIMPLE BUDGET RESOLUTION WITH A RECONCILIATION BILL FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR 25 AND THEN JUST LIKE IT WAS BACK IN 2017. AFTER THAT IS OUT OF THE WAY, THEN WE CAN TAKE ANOTHER BUDGET RESOLUTION FOR FISCAL YEAR 26 AND THAT ONE WILL BE THE ONE WITH TAX BILLS. > > HOW DOES WAITING ON THE DEBT CEILING COMPLICATE MATTERS FOR THIS CONGRESS? IF YOU ARE PUTTING YOURSELF IN MIKE JOHNSON ' S SHOES, YOU WILL THEN HAVE TO ADD THAT TO ALREADY A COMPLICATE IT MAKES OF POLICIES. QUITE YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. IF I WAS ADVISING, AND I AM NOT, I WAS ADVISING, WHEN YOU ARE DOING THIS BUDGET RESOLUTION THAT YOU GOT REPUBLICAN SUPPORT BEHIND AND A RECONCILIATION BILL, YOU CAN RECONCILE THE DEBT LIMIT AND I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY MIGHT -- THEY MAY STILL CONSIDER THAT IF THEY CAN PASS THE BUDGET RESOLUTION AND RECONCILE THE DEBT LIMIT. OTHERWISE, IT ' S GOING TO COME DOWN TO DO THEY HAVE 60 VOTES SOMETIME MATE SPRING, EARLY SUMMER, TO INCREASE THE STATUTORY DEBT LIMIT? > > WE CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THE VOTES ARE THERE FOR A NUMBER OF THESE THINGS. THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIS CABINET ASSEMBLED AND WE ARE COUNTING VOTES FOR SOME OF THESE MORE CONTROVERSIAL NOMINEES TO SEE IF THEY CAN GET OVER THE FINISH LINE. TULSI GABBARD, PETE, RK JUNIOR WHO WAS MAKING THE ROUNDS THIS WEEK. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM YOUR CONTACTS IN THE SENATE ABOUT THEIR PROSPECTS? > > NOT A LOT. WHAT I HEAR FROM MY FRIENDS IS THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE THE HEARINGS, GO FORWARD, AND GIVE THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT TO THE PRESIDENT BUT -- THE PROPOSED NOMINEES. THEY WANT TO HAVE THE HEARINGS. THEY WANT TO DO REGULAR ORDER. THERE WAS A TIME WHERE THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT BYPASSING RECESS APPOINTMENTS. I DO NOT HEAR THAT ANYMORE. I HEAR THAT THEY DO WANT TO FOLLOW AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE REGULAR ORDER. I ALSO HEAR THAT, AND I AM NOT A BIG FOOTBALL FAN, BUT THE PRESIDENT-ELECT HAS KIND OF FLOODED THE INFIELD. SOME OF THEM WILL MAKE IT AND ARE CONTROVERSIAL SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH POLITICAL CAPITAL SENATE REPUBLICANS HAVE AND THEY CANNOT DEFEAT HIS COMBINATIONS. > > WHAT YOU SEE ANY OF THESE NOMINEES PERHAPS GETTING VOTED DOWN? IT IS PRETTY RARE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. WOULD IT BE SOMETHING THAT THE SENATE PERHAPS ON ONE OF THE MORE LIGHTNING ROD NOMINEES, IF YOU WILL, MIGHT SEND A SIGNAL TO THE PRESIDENT-ELECT. > > LISTEN, I SHOULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT I SAY HERE. I SEE RFK JUNIOR HAVING SOME DIFFICULTY. I DON ' T THINK SENATOR MCCONNELL IS GOING TO SUPPORT HIM. I THINK SENATOR CASSIDY IS GOING TO HAVE HIS HEARINGS. SO HE ' S GOING TO LOSE SOME REPUBLICAN SUPPORT. WILL THERE BE DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT ENOUGH TO BRING HIM ACROSS THE LINE? RIGHT NOW AND AGAIN, LET ' S BE FAIR, HE ' S MEETING THIS WEEK AND I THINK HE HAS SOME REAL CHALLENGES. THE OTHER ONCE AGAIN, THE HEARINGS MAY REVEAL THINGS THAT PEOPLE WILL HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT. I THINK THE MAJORITY OF HIS NOMINEES WILL AT THE END OF THE DAY MAKE IT THROUGH BUT I THINK SOME MAY NOT. > > I AM GLAD YOU RAISED THE PROSPECT OF DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT. WE HAVE THAT QUESTION IN A LOT OF AREAS WHEN IT COMES TO THESE VERY LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AS IN THIS CONGRESS, 118TH. IT REQUIRED DEMOCRATIC VOTES TO GET EVERYTHING PASSED OVER THE FINISH LINE. ARE REPUBLICANS GOING TO BE ABLE TO COUNT ON THAT IN THE SAME WAY IN JANUARY? > > MARGIN NOW BACK WHEN PAUL RYAN WAS THERE, HE HAD -- ON HIS BUDGET RESOLUTION RECONCILIATION BILL, HE LOST 20 REPUBLICAN VOTES. WHEN YOU HAVE A MARGIN THAT IS AS NARROW AS IT IS, THEY ARE GOING TO NEED -- THEY ARE EITHER GOING TO HAVE TO BE VERY UNITED OR THEY WILL NEED SOME DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT. AND I AM NOT A POLITICAL SCIENTIST BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT DEMOCRATS WILL BE LOOKING AT MIDTERM 2026 WHEN THEY THINK THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO TAKE BACK THE HOUSE SO I DON ' T EXPECT A LOT OF SUPPORT OUT OF THE DEMOCRATS TO HELP OUT, IF YOU LIKE, GET THINGS ACROSS THE FINISH LINE AND THAT IS WHY WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE ANOTHER CONTINUING RESOLUTION ONCE AGAIN GOING INTO THE MIDDLE OF NEXT YEAR. > > WHAT KIND OF HORSETRADING CAN WE EXPECT TO TAKE PLACE WITH THESE NARROW MARGINS?

SO FAR, HE SAYING HE WANTS HIS FULL INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. HE HAS DITCHED THE JIHADIS LOOK, FRANKLY, AND HE IS NOW DONNING A SUIT AND NO MORE WEARING COMBAT BOOTS, FOR EXAMPLE. HE IS REINVENTING HIS ENTIRE LIP AND NAME AND SAYING HE WANTS TO WORK WITH OTHERS TO SET UP FOR ELECTION AND TO PROTECT MINORITIES AND SO ON. IS IT IS TO SEEM TO SEE IF THAT WILL PLAY OUT. THE PRIME MINISTER THAT HE HAS APPOINTED TO TAKE CONTROL FOR THIS CARETAKER GOVERNMENT IF YOU WILL WAS SEEN STANDING IN FRONT OF THE SYRIAN FLAG THAT WAS USED DURING THE PROTEST AND A FLAG THAT EVOKES A VERY STRONG ISLAMIST ETHERS AND SOMETHING THAT IS TYPICALLY USED -- WAS USED BY THE RENTABLE -- THE REBEL GROUP BUT OTHER ISLAMIST MILITIA GROUPS AND THAT IS SCARY TO CERTAIN MINORITIES. YOU HAVE COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD LIKE THE UNITED STATES, THE U.K., AND OTHERS, SAYING IT MIGHT BE TOO SOON TO WITHDRAW THE TARIFFS -- TERRORIST DESIGNATION OF THIS GROUP BECAUSE THEY ARE WAITING TO SEE IF HE ACTUALLY DELIVERS HIS PROMISES. > > QUESTION FOR YOU ON THE PROCESS AND HOW IT WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE CHANGING IN POWER HERE IN WASHINGTON. WE ARE NOT JUST SEEING A CHANGE OF POWER IN SYRIA. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A TRANSITION HERE IN WASHINGTON AND WE HEARD DONALD TRUMP SAY THAT SYRIA MAY NOT BE AS HIGH ON THE LIST OF NATIONAL SECURITY PRIORITIES. WHERE DOES THAT TAKE US AFTER JANUARY 20? > > TO BE FAIR, THE POLICIES, THEY ARE GOING TO BE SEPARATE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THERE IS INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE BY THE CIVIL SERVANTS. YOU HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTS WHO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FILE FOR A LONG TIME EVEN IF IT HAS NOT HAD A LOT OF PUBLIC PROMINENCE SO THEY ARE GOING TO PUSH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ANYWAY TO DO THE BARE MINIMUM WISHES TO PROTECT THE CURRENT -- WHICH IS TO PROTECT THE KURDS AND ENSURE THAT ANY AMERICANS THERE -- PERHAPS THERE ARE OTHERS ARE RELEASED AND HOME AND WE DO WHAT WE CAN TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS FOR SOME KIND OF STABLE TRANSITION, THAT THERE ARE THOSE ELECTIONS THAT THEY ARE PROMISING THAT THEY DO TAKE PLACE IN A FAIR WAY AND THAT WE DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO SUPPORT THAT BUT WITHOUT INTERFERING TOO MUCH. THE UNITED STATES IS NOT PERCEIVED IN A VERY POSITIVE LIGHT IN SYRIA AND IT HAS NOT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR IN 2011 BECAUSE THE U.S. TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF HANDS OFF APPROACH WITH SYRIA. WE WERE NOT LEADING -- WE ARE LEADING FROM BEHIND. THAT IS A COMMON EXPRESSION YOU HEARD ON THIS ISSUE SO THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF ANIMOSITY THERE. A LITTLE BIT OF GRIEVANCES ABOUT HOW THE U.S. AND EUROPE HANDLED SYRIA WHEN YOU HAVE THESE ATROCITIES TAKEN PLACE AND THE SELLOUT -- THE SLAUGHTER OF CIVILIANS. TRUMP KNOWS THAT AND BIDED NOSE THAT AS WELL.

PARKS WE ARE DEFINITELY GETTING WARMER BUT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS DEAL WILL HAPPEN IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS OR THE WAY IT IS BEING COMMUNICATED OR BY THE TIME TRUMP TAKES OFFICE, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY AS IT WAS FOR EVERY OTHER TIME THAT WE WERE CLOSE TO A DEAL. THE REASON IT FEELS WARMER, THE REASON FOR THE OPTIMISM IS BECAUSE HAMAS IS NEVER BEEN MORE ISOLATED. NOT ONLY HAVE THEY BEEN COMPLETELY DECIMATED OVER THE LAST OVER A YEAR BUT WITH THE FALL OF BASHAR AL-ASSAD, IT PUT THINGS IN A STARK REALITY FOR THEM AND IT WAS NOT THE CASE EVEN A FEW MONTHS AGO WHERE NOW YOU HAVE HEZBOLLAH HAS BEEN DECAPITATED AND DECIMATED AND IRAN IS ON THE DEFENSE NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN ATTACKED BUT BECAUSE IT ' S DEFENSE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN ATTACKED BY ISRAEL AND NOW THE LAST REMAINING BUDDY, BASHAR AL-ASSAD, HAS FLOWN LIKE A COWARD TO MOSCOW SO THEY ARE CAVING IN ON CERTAIN HAMAS -- HAMAS IS CAVING IN ON CERTAIN DETAILS THAT THEY WERE NOT WILLING TO COMPROMISE ON BEFORE, NAMELY THE QUESTION OF THE REMAINING PRESENCE OF ISRAELI TROOPS, PARTICULARLY IN THE PHILADELPHIA CORRIDOR WHICH BORDERS BETWEEN GAZA AND EGYPT AND ALSO SURROUNDING GAZA. THAT IS SOMETHING THEY WERE NOT WILLING TO DISCUSS BEFORE AND NOW THEY ARE SO THAT IS THE REASON FOR THE OPTIMISM. THE FACT IS THAT THOSE DETAILS, THE NITTY-GRITTY DETAILS WAS 10% THAT IT ALWAYS BOILS DOWN TO ARE STILL NOT FULLY AGREED TO SO IT COULD HAPPEN.

THEY KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM AND WHERE IT WENT AND FOR SOME REASON, THEY DON ' T WANT TO COMMENT. I CANNOT IMAGINE IT IS THE ENEMY BECAUSE IT WAS THE ENEMY THAT BLASTED OUT, EVEN IF THEY WERE LATE, THAT BLASTED. SOMETHING STRANGE IS GOING ON. FOR SOME REASON, THEY DON ' T WANT TO TELL THE PEOPLE AND THEY SHOULD BECAUSE THE PEOPLE -- IT HAPPENED TO BE OVER ONE ANOTHER, TOO. THEY ARE VERY CLOSE TO BEDMINSTER. I THINK I WILL NOT SPEND THE WEEKEND IN BEDMINSTER. I DECIDED TO CANCEL MY TRIP. > > SO WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF THIS STORY ABOUT THE DRONES? IT REALLY IS ONE THAT IS NOT ONLY NOT GOING AWAY BUT REALLY TAKING HOLD IN THE PUBLIC IMAGINATION AND FOR THE PRESIDENT-ELECT? > > YOU KNOW WHAT IS SO FASCINATING ABOUT WHAT PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP SAID IS THAT HE IS COMMUNICATING WHAT MANY AMERICANS IN THE NORTHEAST ARE FEELING WHICH IS THIS UTTER CONFUSION AND FRUSTRATION IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THAT THEY ARE SAYING THEY DON ' T KNOW WHERE THESE ARE COMING FROM AND THERE IS NO ACTION TAKEN AFTER THEM. HE SAYS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT KNOWS BUT THAT THEY ARE UNWILLING TO SHARE THE INFORMATION AND I CANNOT VERIFY THAT AT ALL. HE IS BRIEFED ON INTELLIGENCE IN THE RUN-UP TO HIM TAKING OFFICE IN JANUARY SO I WILL SAY THAT AND I DON ' T KNOW IF HE HAS BEEN BRIEF WITH SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE THAT HE IS SHARING PUBLICLY THAT OTHERS ARE NOT. THAT SAID, THERE IS AN IMPORTANT POINT HERE AND THAT IS THAT THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ONE YEAR NOW AND YOU HAD ALSO A SERIES OF DRONES THAT WERE HOVERING AROUND A MILITARY BASE IN VIRGINIA FOR 17 DAYS STRAIGHT AND IT DID NOT GET MUST -- MUCH PRESS ATTENTION AND NOW IT IS GETTING MORE WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE YOU MAKE IN PUBLIC DESERVES TO KNOW WHAT THESE ARE. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT REGARDING THE DRONES A YEAR AGO AND THESE DRONES NOW ARE SAYING THEY DON ' T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE BUT THEY CLAIM THAT FOR SURE, IT IS NOT A FOREIGN ADVERSARY. I DON‚Äô ' T KNOW HOW THEY CAN BE SO SURE IT IS A FOREIGN ADVERSARY IF THEY ALSO DO NOT KNOW WHERE IT IS COMING ON BUT AS A FORM OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, I WANT TO BE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT SAYING THAT THEY CANNOT CONFIRM OR DENY. USUALLY, WHEN THEY KNOW BUT THEY DON ' T WANT TO SAY, THEY SAY THEY CAN NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY. THAT IS STILL A MAJOR PROBLEM BECAUSE WHETHER IT IS A FOREIGN ADVERSARY OR GARAGE, THIS IS A MASSIVE NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT BECAUSE THEY ARE COMMUNICATING TO FOREIGN ADVERSARIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT THEY COULD SEND DRONES HERE AND THAT WE MAY NOT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE FROM. WE DON ' T HAVE THE TECHNOLOGIES TO DO IT AND BY THE WAY, MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE DON ' T HAVE THE LAST TO SHOOT THEM DOWN UNLESS THEY POSE A DIRECT AND IMMINENT THREAT. WELL, PERSONALLY, I WOULD ARGUE THAT IF ANY DRONE IS COLLECTING INTELLIGENCE WORK SHOWS THAT IT CAN FLY OVER THESE NAVAL BASES OR MILITARY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THAT DOES POSE AN IMMINENT THREAT BECAUSE EVENTUALLY, IT COMMUNICATES TO SOMEBODY THAT THEY CAN HOVER AROUND AND PERHAPS TAKE ACTION AND WE WILL NOT KNOW WHERE IT IS COMING FROM. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THEY NEED TO GET THE TECHNOLOGY TO ASSERT THIS. THEY NEED TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND WHILE THIS IS ABOVE MY PAY GRADE, I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD DECLARE AT LEAST ONE OF THESE DRONES A THREAT AND SHOOT IT DOWN SO THEY SEND A VERY STRONG MESSAGE TO FOREIGN ADVERSARIES AROUND THE WORLD BUT AGAIN, WE ABOVE MY PAY GRADE.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.7913093566894531,neutral,0.5600163340568542,Neutral

The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear TikTok‚Äôs challenge to a law that would ban the popular social media app next month unless its Chinese owner sells it.

The U.S. Supreme Court has decided to hear TikTok‚Äôs challenge to a law that would ban the popular social media app next month unless its Chinese owner sells it.

The case is set for Jan. 10, nine days before TikTok is scheduled to be shut down in the U.S.

In announcing its decision, the court instructed lawyers for TikTok and the government to prepare arguments around the question of whether the impending ban, which lawmakers feel is needed to block potential meddling by Chinese authorities, would violate the 1st Amendment.

With time running out before the ban takes effect Jan. 19, the justices agreed to decide the TikTok case on a fast-track basis, scheduling two hours of oral argument.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pleased with today‚Äôs Supreme Court order,‚Äù TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe believe the Court will find the TikTok ban unconstitutional so the over 170 million Americans on our platform can continue to exercise their free speech rights.‚Äù

The legal battle over TikTok poses a conflict between the American tradition of wide-open free speech versus the potential national security threat of a Chinese-owned company that collects the personal data of its users.

TikTok‚Äôs future in the U.S. has been uncertain since 2020, when then-President Trump moved to shut down the short-form video app, which people use to share dance routines, news stories, recipes and funny videos.

Trump and others raised the prospect that ByteDance, which owns TikTok, could assist the Chinese government by sharing data it collects from its American users; embedding malicious software in the app; or helping to spread disinformation.

That set off years of back-and-forth between TikTok and the U.S. government. In April, President Biden signed a law that required ByteDance to sell its U.S. operations to a non-Chinese entity or be shut down.

The companies responded by suing the U.S. government in May, saying a ban would violate 1st Amendment rights. They also said that the new law ‚Äúoffers no support for the idea‚Äù that TikTok‚Äôs Chinese ownership poses national security risks.

‚ÄúSpeculative risk of harm is simply not enough when First Amendment values are at stake,‚Äù TikTok and ByteDance said in their filing.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the law two weeks ago, paving the way for a Supreme Court showdown.

In a 3-0 decision, the D.C. Circuit Court rejected TikTok‚Äôs free-speech claim, saying the government is not opposed to the content on the social media platform, but to the owner of it.

Judge Douglas Ginsburg cited testimony from the government‚Äôs security experts who concluded that they ‚Äúdid not trust‚Äù TikTok‚Äôs owners to protect the privacy of Americans. That is not a problem of social media in general, he said.

‚ÄúTikTok is the only global platform of its kind that has been designated by the political branches as a foreign adversary controlled application,‚Äù Ginsburg wrote in the Dec. 6 decision.

Like the appellate court, the Supreme Court justices could be wary of overturning the judgment of Congress and two presidents on a matter of national security.

In the spring, a few notable names announced their interest in buying the U.S. portion of TikTok, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said he was assembling an investor group. Since the law passed, however, there has been little public indication of a possible sale.

On Wednesday, another interested buyer, former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, said he expected the Supreme Court to uphold the law and reiterated his plans to make an offer along with other investors.

The group‚Äôs proposal, McCourt said in a statement, would ‚Äúmigrate this vibrant community to an American-made tech stack that gives people control of their data and embraces a transparent approach to content recommendation and moderation.‚Äù

Free speech organizations have warned that enforcing the ban would set a bad precedent.

‚ÄúWe should be concerned about this law as Americans who engage with one another on social media, but we should also be concerned about the global system of free expression,‚Äù said George Wang, staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute.

If the law is upheld, he said, it‚Äôs ‚Äúhard to see where the stopping point is.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuture bans of social media platforms are possible, but maybe also other forms of media,‚Äù Wang said. ‚ÄúIt really blesses the government‚Äôs ability and authority to shut down entire platforms for speech on pretty vague national security justifications.‚Äù

TikTok on Monday said that its estimates showed that small businesses on the platform would lose ‚Äúmore than $1 billion in revenue and creators would suffer almost $300 million in lost earnings in just one month‚Äù unless the ban was halted.

TikTok‚Äôs lawyer before the high court, Noel Francisco, is a familiar figure for the justices, having served as U.S. solicitor general during Trump‚Äôs first term.

2024-12-18T00:00:00Z,News,foxbusiness.com,https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/supreme-court-take-up-challenge-tiktok-ban,"Supreme Court to take up challenge to TikTok ban

The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it will hear arguments over a new law that would ban use of the popular social media app TikTok in the U.S. unless its Chinese parent company allows it to be sold.

Justices said they will hold a special session on Jan. 10 to hear oral arguments in the case ‚Äî an expedited timeline that will allow them to consider the case just nine days before the Jan. 19 ban is slated to take effect.

The news comes two days after TikTok and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, filed an emergency application to the high court asking justices to temporarily block the law from being enforced while it appealed a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

TECH LEADERS BEZOS, ZUCKERBERG, COOK AND PICHAI LOOK FOR FACE TIME WITH TRUMP

Lawyers for TikTok have argued that the law passed earlier this year is a First Amendment violation, noting in their Supreme Court request that ""Congress's unprecedented attempt to single out applicants and bar them from operating one of the most significant speech platforms in this nation"" and ""presents grave constitutional problems that this court likely will not allow to stand.""

The news comes as President-elect Trump has signaled support for TikTok. On Monday, Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, telling reporters during a press conference ahead of the meeting that his incoming administration will ""take a look at TikTok"" and on the looming U.S. ban.

""I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,"" Trump told reporters.

TikTok cited this relationship directly in its emergency filing to the Supreme Court, arguing that an interim injunction ""is also appropriate because it will give the incoming Administration time to determine its position, as the President-elect and his advisors have voiced support for saving TikTok.""

""There is a strong public interest that this Court have the opportunity to exercise plenary review,"" lawyers for the company said.

The Supreme Court‚Äôs decision to hear the case comes after Congress passed legislation in April giving TikTok nine months to either divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or be removed from U.S. app stores and hosting services.

Lawmakers have cited concerns that China could use the app to download user data or otherwise push certain state-backed content on U.S. users.

In what might become a building block for a last-minute reprieve, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed Wednesday to take up a case, after ByteDance, the Chinese Communist Party-affiliated owner of social media platform TikTok, asked the high court to make an emergency review of the upcoming law that would ban its website.

As our colleague at sister site Townhall.com, Jeff Charles, wrote earlier:

The Supreme Court announced on Wednesday that it will hear a challenge to a new law that would lead to the banning of video sharing site TikTok. In the announcement, the Court said it would allocate two hours for oral argument on Friday, January 10, 2025. The ban is set to take effect on January 19, 2025. TikTok has been seeking out other avenues to stop the implementation of the law and has been unsuccessful up until now.

President-elect Donald Trump also met with the CEO of TikTok on Monday. During his remarks, Trump heaped praise on TikTok for helping him win in November's presidential election, saying he ""[has] a warm spot in [his] heart"" for the site:

The move by SCOTUS comes after the law's passing and being signed into law by President Joe Biden in April, then an appeals court ruled in early December that the social media platform would either need to find a non-Chinese owner within six weeks or end operations.

A lot of things happened. Here are some of the things. This is TPM‚Äôs Morning Memo. Sign up for the email version.

Welcome To Trump II

MAGA Republicans led by Elon Musk and under pressure from Donald Trump are now poised to ruin Christmas with a government shutdown and New Year‚Äôs with an internecine fight over whether Mike Johnson will be re-elected as speaker of the House.

With a government shutdown deadline looming tomorrow, Trump blew up the bipartisan deal for a continuing resolution to fund the government through mid-March via an unhinged social media post late Wednesday afternoon. The details of the CR itself barely matter because this isn‚Äôt about legislation or compromise or striking a deal. It‚Äôs about creating a public spectacle, and nothing made that more clear than Trump‚Äôs last-minute demand that Congress raise the debt ceiling before he even takes office.

Those are the facts of what happened, but after years of GOP brinksmanship, chronic self-ownage, disarray, and dysfunction, it is hard to credibly muster the same kind of alarm or dismay in the face of these facts.

Republicans created this debacle on purpose. They own it. They are the only ones who can stop it. Elected Democrats can‚Äôt save Republicans from themselves, aren‚Äôt to blame for this folly, and are merely bystanders like the rest of us to performative hijinks that are divorced from the reality of governance.

Real people will be hurt or will have to endure another round of living under the threat of harm. It‚Äôs a colossal waste of public resources and private emotional energy. It‚Äôs another spectacle for the sake of spectacle, and we are not even the audience.

The Public Menace Of Elon Musk

Driving the right-wing backlash against House Republicans over the now-abandoned continuing resolution to fund the federal government through mid-March was the erratic and impetuous richest man in the world, posting furiously on the social media platform he owns:

WSJ: ‚ÄúWith a 4:15 a.m. ET social-media post on Wednesday, Elon Musk declared that a must-do spending bill ‚Äòshould not pass.‚Äô By early evening, the bill was dead, leaving the government barreling toward a weekend shutdown just before Christmas.‚Äù

WaPo: ‚ÄúOver the ensuing 12 hours, Musk went on a prolific tirade against the bill ‚Äî with more than 60 updates, some of which boosted false claims ‚Äî that stood out even for a chronic poster who has commanded an audience of more than 200 million followers by broadcasting his largely uninhibited views on the site he owns.‚Äù

Politico: ‚ÄúAmong the 100-plus tweets Musk sent as part of his campaign were a number of misleading or outright false claims ‚Äî a possible preview of the mogul‚Äôs new role as co-leader of a Trump-blessed effort to slash government funding.‚Äù

TPM‚Äôs Josh Marshall: ‚ÄúTrump has sewn himself into a sack with Elon Musk, a few billion dollars, a cat and a snake, and had the sack tossed into the Tiber. That‚Äôs the story here. And it will go on for a while.‚Äù

Can Mike Johnson Survive As Speaker?

Support for Mike Johnson to remain as speaker seemed to evaporate Wednesday:

Punchbowl: ‚ÄúThe speaker election is in 15 days. There are members‚Äìmore than a dozen‚Äìwho assert that Johnson won‚Äôt be the speaker in the next Congress. It‚Äôs early. Let‚Äôs see how Johnson gets out of this mess.‚Äù

Politico: ‚ÄúKentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, a frequent Johnson antagonist, on Wednesday became the first Republican to publicly say he will vote against him for speaker on Jan. 3. Other Republicans, including some who previously said they would support him, now won‚Äôt commit to backing him, despite Trump endorsing Johnson just over a month ago.‚Äù

WaPo: ‚ÄúTwo other GOP members, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic, said the question of support [for Johnson] was likely moot: Based on defections that had yet to become public, Johnson would probably be forced out of the running before lawmakers would have to make up their minds on Jan. 3, the member said.‚Äù

At one level, who cares if Mike John survives. It‚Äôs a thankless job trying to lead a unleadable band of reactionaries. Someone has to do it. Eventually. But if House Republicans re-create a speakership mess like they produced for Kevin McCarthy in 2023 ‚Äì not elected until the 15th ballot, on Jan. 7 ‚Äì it could bump up against the Jan. 6 deadline for certifying the Electoral College results. I know.

The Full Extent Of Patel‚Äôs Awfulness

WaPo: ‚ÄúIn the remarks, made before his selection to be FBI director, Patel floated criminal probes of lawmakers and witnesses who gave evidence to the Jan. 6 select committee, accusing them of providing false testimony and of destroying evidence. Those include former Trump aide Cassidy Hutchinson and police officers who testified about defending the Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack.

Hegseth Not Out Of The Woods Yet

Politico:

At least a dozen senators are pushing to see the FBI‚Äôs background check on Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump‚Äôs embattled pick for Pentagon chief ‚Äî a rare move for the committee that oversees his confirmation and a sign the former Fox News host still faces hurdles in the Senate. Unlike some other committees, the Senate Armed Services usually limits access to these types of background checks to its two lead senators. But pressure is building from both Democrats and Republicans to provide more lawmakers with the ongoing report, whose contents could determine whether Hegseth makes it to the Pentagon.

But His Emails!

The US supreme court surprisingly decided, this week, to hear TikTok‚Äôs emergency appeal to its imminent ban in the United States. It may be the most important case at the intersection of the first amendment and national security in decades. Whether or not you see China as a nefarious threat, all Americans who care about free expression should worry about the precedent this case could set ‚Äì and should want the TikTok ban overturned.

After a fifth circuit court of appeals ruling earlier this month, TikTok‚Äôs owner, ByteDance, has until 19 January to either sell the popular video-sharing app or face a nationwide ban. The decision stems from Congress passing a law last year that essentially proclaims that if the government says a foreign-owned platform threatens national security, then it can force its sale or censor it.

The US‚Äôs core argument is that ByteDance might be handing over user data to the Chinese government. The US government‚Äôs briefs are full of redactions that they‚Äôve not yet shared with the public, despite their unprecedented position that an app used by more than half the country should be permanently made illegal. Officials have publicly admitted that the US position is based on speculation about what China could do, not facts about what it actually does.

Now, no one argues that it‚Äôs not possible that the Chinese government is accessing user data. As someone who has advocated for privacy for more than a decade, we should be much more aware about the information any app is giving any party. What is often lost in this debate is that TikTok collects similar or the same type of data that every other app on our phone does. This data is often packaged and sold to third parties, which the Chinese government probably purchases in bulk anyway. That includes data collected by American apps.

It‚Äôs hard to believe the US government actually cares about Americans‚Äô privacy, when it also engages in this nefarious practice itself. If Congress were truly worried about Americans‚Äô privacy, they could pass something like the Fourth Amendment Is Not for Sale Act, which would essentially ban companies from selling data to the US government without a warrant, where there is a much more direct line to abuse.

The bigger issue here is that lawmakers are using privacy as a shield to hide their true motivations. If you listen to their own words, this isn‚Äôt just about China. In fact, the main impetus for passing this bill might be the Israel-Gaza war. Proposals to ban TikTok were around before the war started ‚Äì and had significant support ‚Äì but never got off the ground.

Several of the law‚Äôs biggest proponents in Congress have openly expressed how they wanted to shut down TikTok specifically because Americans who use the platform are condemning Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza, potentially affecting public opinion at large. Every day there are countless new videos of the death and destruction carried out with US weapons by its closest ally. The fifth circuit conveniently ignored these stated motivations, despite the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University comprehensively cataloging them in a legal brief.

Historically, the US supreme court has deferred to prosecutors to a depressing extreme when they make secret ‚Äúnational security‚Äù claims related to information the government holds ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs the oft-abused state secrets privilege, the prosecution of journalists‚Äô sources or mass-surveillance capabilities. Thankfully, when the first amendment rights of ordinary Americans are at stake, the court has traditionally been more skeptical.

In one of the most famous first amendment cases of the 20th century, the supreme court ruled in the Pentagon papers case that the Nixon administration couldn‚Äôt censor the New York Times from publishing leaked documents just because the government claimed that national security could be harmed. Justice Hugo Black famously wrote: ‚ÄúThe word ‚Äòsecurity‚Äô is a broad, vague generality whose contours should not be invoked to abrogate the fundamental law embodied in the First Amendment.‚Äù

Nowhere in the fifth circuit‚Äôs decision does the court cite or even try to distinguish the TikTok case from that decision ‚Äì they just completely ignore it.

Likewise, the supreme court has also ruled that Americans have the right to consume foreign propaganda if they so choose. In that case, the ‚Äúforeign propaganda‚Äù is much more direct ‚Äì created and distributed from foreign soil ‚Äì not Americans expressing their own opinions on a platform that‚Äôs not directing them to say anything.

In the age of misinformation and foreign influence operations, this first amendment right may seem more controversial to some. It‚Äôs important to point out that no free-expression advocate will argue that propaganda, whether true or not, is a wholly good thing. But the free flow of information ‚Äì good and bad ‚Äì is exactly what separates us from countries like China, which tightly restrict what its citizens can and can‚Äôt see.

The US government has long decried the Chinese government‚Äôs insistence on banning apps and websites because they originate in the United States. Rather than stand on our values, its response in this case has essentially been: Let‚Äôs be more like China.

There is an alternative that would diminish the influence of propagandists without abandoning our values: cutting down on government secrecy and hypocrisy (not to mention the bankrolling of atrocities), which breeds distrust and leads young people to look elsewhere for information.

It‚Äôs possible the supreme court could essentially re-affirm its past precedents upholding the first amendment ‚Äì worryingly, it also could move to weaken or overturn them. That would create a dangerous scenario where the Trump administration could abuse the TikTok law to ban other communications platforms that originated internationally. It could also throw away other long-held first amendment rights with it, affecting publishers, journalists and countless sources of news consumed by Americans.

Trump has done a 180 on his previous position on TikTok. It was his first administration that first attempted to ban the app; he now says he‚Äôll attempt to reverse the ban, though legal experts say he has limited options. Regardless of what he can or can‚Äôt do in this case, it is yet another in a long line of laws that Democrats have supported that could hand Trump extraordinary power to potentially abuse in the future.

Let‚Äôs hope the supreme court does the right thing and strikes down this dangerous grant of censorship power before it spins out of control.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.3101111650466919,surprise,0.5400583744049072,Anti-ban

One of the first cases the Supreme Court will hear in 2025 is a challenge to the TikTok ban scheduled to go into effect next month.

Congress passed a law, signed by President Joe Biden, that would ban the platform unless it is sold to an American company by Jan. 19, with a potential 90-day extension on that deadline.

Oral arguments will be on Jan. 10, and the Supreme Court will weigh whether the ban violates the First Amendment rights of Americans. The justices could delay the ban until later in the year, once they are able to issue a full decision on the merits.

Despite my views favoring free speech, the Supreme Court should uphold the ban, and TikTok should be banned or at least be forced to sell.

TikTok poses a national threat because of China

There are two avenues through which a compelling argument can be made against TikTok. The first and more direct issue is that the Chinese government, in all likelihood, has a direct line of access to data that TikTok collects on Americans.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

The nightmare case is that the Chinese government is directly accessing the data of the 150 million Americans who use TikTok. This data includes name, age, location, direct messages, keystrokes, file names on your device, IP address, biometric data and more. This level of data collection about a direct adversary could prove invaluable to China if that government wants to weaken the United States.

The libertarian in me would be remiss if I didn't mention this is the exact kind of data that Facebook, Google and Snapchat collect on Americans themselves, though the issue here is that of a foreign adversary holding such data.

Even without direct access to that data, the Chinese government has the ability to force TikTok to turn over any data it deems necessary. TikTok has said this is not the case, claiming that U.S. data is stored separately from any that is subject to Chinese law.

However, there is testimony from TikTok employees to refute these claims, and that data is sometimes shared with ByteDance, the Chinese-owned parent company, outside of official channels.

The second, related issue is that of content manipulation. TikTok and other social media platforms are terrifyingly good at knowing what you want to see, and they do so by collecting in-depth data on what you do and don‚Äôt like. For the most part, this information is harmless.

However, en masse, the data gives impressive trendlines on the American public that can be manipulated in any number of ways. Scarier yet is determining what Americans want to see. Skewing the types of content that are being shown, such as boosting pro-socialist content to young Americans, is within the realm of capabilities for the Chinese government with the level of control they have over ByteDance.

Once again, parallels can be drawn to Big Tech in America, but the threat here is that it is being done by a foreign adversary.

Is TikTok being banned? Supreme Court will ultimately decide.

These are political arguments against a ban, and the job of the Supreme Court is to determine what the law says, not what it ought to be.

From a legal standpoint, TikTok‚Äôs challenge to the ban seems relatively weak. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which most recently heard this case, sided against TikTok. Despite noting the First Amendment considerations that are important in this case, the judges (who come from across the ideological spectrum) each concluded that a ban was permissible on national security grounds.

The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act ""was the culmination of extensive, bipartisan action by the Congress and by successive presidents,‚Äù wrote Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg in the majority opinion. ‚ÄúIt was carefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary, and it was part of a broader effort to counter a well-substantiated national security threat posed by"" the People's Republic of China.

The ban does violate a free speech interest, but that is not the purpose of the forced sale/ban of TikTok. The government offered alternatives to an outright ban, giving TikTok time to continue operating while they found a suitable buyer for the platform.

The motive of the legislation is not to limit speech, but rather to protect Americans from data privacy violations by China. The national security risk outweighs the free speech considerations for TikTok‚Äôs users, especially when there are viable alternative platforms on the market. Instagram has already taken a significant market share away from TikTok.

Banning TikTok is a matter of national security, not one of violating free speech, and the justices should treat it as such.

Are users now locked into the TikTok automatic watermark? One user on the platform says that a new update means you can‚Äôt escape it when you share your videos to other social media sites.

Featured Video

Musician Vera Kay‚Äôs concerns quickly went viral after she posted them in a video on the site on Dec. 5.

Her video has other users concerned and has already racked up over 1 million views since it was posted.

With the impending, but not quite certain, TikTok ban scheduled for next year, some users are worried their videos might not be able to be shown on other platforms.

‚ÄúDo not update your TikTok app!!! I‚Äôm literally going to cry,‚Äù Kay‚Äôs video screen text warns.

‚ÄúNow they have taken away the ability to download your videos when you record them without the watermark,‚Äù she claims.

‚ÄúI cannot believe that this just happens,‚Äù she continues. She shows a screenshot showing the options to save without a watermark or with one, claiming the old utility of posting sans watermark is now gone.

What is the TikTok watermark?

According to Vista Social, ‚ÄúThe watermark on TikTok videos is the superimposed logo of the platform with the original creator‚Äôs username.‚Äù

The watermark is used by the site to identify videos for marketing and copyright purposes.

‚ÄúIt makes it crystal clear who the original creator is so other users can‚Äôt repost the TikTok videos without proper attribution.‚Äù

Advertisement

Per Vista Social, the watermark allows original creators to be properly attributed.

TikTok has not acknowledged whether or not the automatic watermark claimed by Kay is in effect. It has not been discussed on the site‚Äôs newsroom page as either a feature or a bug.

How to get rid of it

There are several ways to get rid of the watermark in the face of any upcoming ban according to Yahoo! Tech.

They recommend three methods.

Grab a snippet of a public video in GIF form. ‚ÄúLong-press on a video and tap Save Video. The video is placed in your phone‚Äôs camera roll, and you‚Äôll see options there to share it via SMS, Facebook, WhatsApp, or other services.‚Äù Use a third-party app to erase the watermarks (Warning: Beware of copyright for this option). They warn, ‚ÄúThe results can look sloppy because they essentially blur watermarks by adding extra pixels to the video frames.‚Äù Video ‚Äúgrabs‚Äù using other third-party apps. ‚ÄúThe best bet is to download videos without any watermarks in the first place, for free, using third-party apps and helper websites, which require the URL for the individual TikTok videos.‚Äù

One viewer suggests another alternate method. ‚ÄúFor the 25th time: POST IT PRIVATE. DOWNLOAD. DELETE,‚Äù writes Arch Bishop Don ‚ÄúMagic‚Äù WAT? (@nuteraygun) in the video‚Äôs comments.

Viewers are upset

Viewers of Kay‚Äôs video overwhelmingly shared her concerns.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt update mine and it still was done without my consent.‚Äù The Nurse and the Nerd wrote one user.

‚ÄúMine just updated itself I DIDN‚ÄôT WANT IT,‚Äù another added.

Someone else wrote, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so upset about this.‚Äù

However, some comments offered fixes to the supposed problem.

‚ÄúIt will save it without the watermark if you post it. So just post ‚Äòonly you‚Äô,‚Äù one stated.

Another user commented, ‚ÄòPost and save without watermark‚Äô then immediately ‚Äòdelete and re-edit‚Äô.‚Äù

The Daily Dot reached out to Kay via TikTok and Instagram messenger for further comment. The Daily Dot has reached out to TikTok via its website for a statement.

President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday pledged to commence ‚Äúthe largest deportation operation in American history‚Äù as soon as he takes office on Jan. 20, 2025, and mused about keeping TikTok around as well.

‚ÄúOn my first day back in the Oval Office, I will sign a historic slate of executive orders to close our border to illegal aliens and stop the invasion of our country,‚Äù Trump proclaimed to a friendly crowd at Turning Point Action‚Äôs AmericaFest conference in Phoenix.

‚ÄúAnd on that same day, we will begin the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than that of President Dwight D Eisenhower,‚Äù he added.

Throughout his 2024 campaign, Trump, 78, had vowed to undertake a mass deportation campaign against illegal immigrants residing within the US. He has tapped Tom Homan as his border czar designee to carry out that mission. Homan spoke earlier at the conservative conference.

Trump also crowed about his strong performance with young voters for a Republican candidate and credited TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is facing a Jan. 19, 2025 deadline to either divest or face a ban of the popular video-sharing platform on the Google and Apple app stores in the US.

‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre going to have to start thinking about TikTok,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúWe did go on TikTok. We had a great response with billions of views‚Ä¶and it was so beautiful to see.‚Äù

‚ÄúI said, we got to keep this sucker around a little while.‚Äù

During his first administration, Trump signed an executive order to block the popular video-sharing site, but a court later scuttled that move.

Trump later warmed up to the platform amid efforts by billionaire GOP donor Jeff Yass, who invested in TikTok.

TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew met with the president-elect in Mar-a-Lago last week to make his case for an intervention. Trump has previously credited his campaign‚Äôs use of TikTok for his performance with younger voters and mused that sacking TikTok could be a boon for Facebook.

Underlying the divestment bill were concerns about ByteDance‚Äôs links to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and a national security surveillance law in China.

Lawmakers and experts alike have warned that through TikTok, Beijing could access a vast trove of browsing history, biometric identifiers, location data and more from US users.

There had also been fears about the CCP deploying TikTok as a propaganda tool within the US.

Trump has previously shrugged off many of those concerns.

The president-elect‚Äôs appearance at AmericaFest marks his first major rally since winning the 2024 election. An assortment of prominent conservative figures such as Homan, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and others delivered speeches at the conference.

Gaetz, who resigned from Congress last month and is bracing for the release of a House Committee on Ethics report this week, appeared to briefly flirt with a Senate run during his address.

Trump also pledged to take aim at fentanyl via a public awareness initiative intended to curb the crisis. Nearly 74,000 deaths in 2022 involved synethic opioids like fentanyl, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to do very big advertising campaigns, just like a campaign for running for president. We spend a lot of money,‚Äù Trump teased. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to advertise how bad drugs are for you‚Ä¶They ruin your looks, they ruin your face, they ruin your skin and ruin your teeth. If you want to have horrible teeth, take a lot of fentanyl. You want to have skin that looks so terrible, take fentanyl.‚Äù

Republicans have long contended that the border crisis has exacerbated the spread of the synthetic opioid within the US. Many Republican areas of the country have been ravaged by the fentanyl crisis, and it was a dominant issue in the 2024 GOP primary.

Shortly after winning the 2024 election, Trump threatened the leaders of Canada, Mexico and China with tariffs, seeking further actions on their part to curb the spread of precursor chemicals.

During his wide-ranging speech at AmericaFest, Trump also doubled down on his grievance that the US Navy and commerce have been treated ‚Äúunfairly‚Äù by Panama.

‚Äú[It‚Äôs] ridiculous, highly unfair, especially knowing the extraordinary generosity that has been bestowed to Panama, I say, very foolishly, by the United States,‚Äù he said. ‚Äú[The] complete rip off of our country will immediately stop. It‚Äôs going to stop.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe United States has a big invested interest in the secure, efficient and reliable operation of the Panama Canal that was always understood when they gave it to Panama.‚Äù",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.5738993883132935,neutral,0.8097021579742432,Anti-ban

President-elect Donald Trump wants to keep TikTok ‚Äî at least, right now he does.

At AmericaFest, hosted by Turning Point USA and Turning Point Action, on Sunday, Trump said he ""did go on TikTok and we had a great response with billions of views."" Trump has 14.7 million followers on the app. While his videos regularly have many millions of views, there doesn't appear to be any videos on his TikTok page with ""billions of views."" The video with the most views is the first he posted, with nearly 179 million views.

""They brought me a chart, and it was a record, and it was so beautiful to see, and as I looked at it, I said, 'Maybe we gotta keep this sucker around for a little while,'"" he said, according to Reuters. This comes just after Trump met with TikTok's CEO and said he had a ""warm spot"" for the app.

This is the newest approach Trump has taken on the platform, a significant change from his 2020 attempts to ban it.

It comes at a time in which a TikTok ban seems imminent. President Joe Biden signed a bill into law in April that would ban TikTok in the U.S. on Jan. 19 unless ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, divests from the app. A federal appeals court upheld Biden's law. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear TikTok's challenge of the ruling, but the deadline still looms.

It's unclear what Trump will actually do to stop the ban on TikTok. He doesn't become president until the day after the ban goes into effect, and the president-elect can't make any legislative changes ‚Äî no matter how badly he says he wants to ""keep this sucker around.""",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.2953555583953857,neutral,0.8455748558044434,Anti-ban

In less than one month, TikTok could be banned from app stores throughout the United States. But in a last-minute decision, the Supreme Court agreed to hear out arguments from TikTok and its Chinese parent company about why a ban could be unconstitutional.

This spring, President Joe Biden passed legislation that would ban TikTok in January if its Chinese parent company ByteDance does not sell it. The legislation has been in the works for several years, as government officials fear that TikTok is a national security concern.

If ByteDance does not sell TikTok by Jan. 19, the app will be illegal for distribution through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Internet service providers will also be required to make the app inaccessible on U.S. internet browsers.

Here's what to know about the TikTok ban, including when SCOTUS will review the legislation.

When will Supreme Court review the TikTok ban?

The Supreme Court is set to review TikTok' arguments on Jan. 10, 2025, just over a week before the ban could be implemented.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

What is TikTok asking SCOTUS to do?

TikTok wants SCOTUS to overturn a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which states that the legislation's infringement of free speech rights is justified because of national security concerns.

When could the TikTok ban go into place?

The ban will go into place on Sunday, Jan. 19, 2025, if ByteDance does not sell the platform by then.

Could TikTok be bought?

Though China has been vocal in the past about its opposition to selling TikTok, billionaire Frank McCourt has expressed his interest in purchasing the U.S. portion of the platform with a group of associates. McCourt, founder of Project Liberty and executive chairman of McCourt Global, said a consortium of associates has verbally pledged up to $20 billion for the purchase.

However, if McCourt purchased TikTok, it would only be the U.S. portion and would not include TikTok's algorithm, which China sees as its intellectual property, McCourt told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" earlier this month.

Does Donald Trump want to ban TikTok?

President-elect Donald Trump's vision for TikTok when he takes office is unclear. Despite steps he took during his first term to ward off ByteDance, he has expressed different feelings for the app more recently.

Last week, Trump said during a press conference that he has a ""warm spot"" for TikTok in his heart, as he believes the app helped him gain ground with young voters in the 2024 presidential election.

‚ÄúTikTok had an impact, and so we're taking a look at it,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI have a little bit of a warm spot in my heart. I'll be honest.""

USA TODAY has reached out to Trump's team for comment.

Why did the government create the ban?

Concerns about national security stem from worries that ByteDance, which is based in Beijing, has access to American data and is sharing it with the Chinese government.

In 2020, Trump issued an executive order regarding TikTok. As part of the order, Trump tried to ban TikTok in the U.S. and prohibit any transactions with the company, according to the Trump White House archival website. However, this ban never went into place.

In 2021, Biden revoked Trump's proposed ban and issued a new executive order regarding ByteDance, which said that the company ""continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States,"" a U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit court opinion federal appeals court opinion states. In 2022, Biden signed a bill that prohibited the use of TikTok on government devices.

What is TikTok?

TikTok is a social media application known for its short-form videos. Users can create, post and interact with videos on the app. TikTok is popular for its scrolling algorithm and allows users to post videos between three seconds and 10 minutes long. Users may add different filters, backgrounds, music and stickers to their videos.

2024-12-25T00:00:00Z,News,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/25/politics/scotus-teenagers-tiktok-vaping-trans-youth/index.html,"The Supreme Court enters its teenager era

CNN ‚Äî

Like millions of American teens, Kailey Corum is savvy about the dangers of TikTok ‚Äî but she‚Äôs also wary about government efforts to shut it down.

The Virginia high school student uses the platform to catch up on news, listen to music and discover cooking tips. She chooses her words carefully when describing whether she trusts the Supreme Court to decide the fate of an app that 17% of teenagers report using ‚Äúalmost constantly.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt put, exactly, full faith into it,‚Äù said Corum, a junior, as she stood outside the Supreme Court after a recent tour of the building with her classmates. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs not much personally I can do.‚Äù

In the coming months, the Supreme Court will decide a series of blockbuster cases that could significantly transform the lives of the nation‚Äôs teenagers ‚Äî potentially limiting access to vaping products, upholding a ban on transgender care for minors and deciding whether the controversial TikTok law can be squared with the First Amendment.

The appeals have made their way to the justices ‚Äî including two who still have teenage children ‚Äî at a moment when lawmakers are engaging in fierce culture war fights over school book bans, transgender student athletes and the teaching of American history ‚Äì prompting a flood of litigation that is already working its way through federal courts.

The disputes are heating up even as there are signs that young people are especially disillusioned with Washington generally and the Supreme Court specifically. A Marquette Law School poll last week found the high court‚Äôs approval among Americans 18-29 stands at 44%, lower than any other age category.

‚ÄúIt does feel like the biggest cases are ones that will directly implicate children‚Äôs interests,‚Äù said Aaron Tang, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, who specializes in education law. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we should be surprised that more and more cases are going to get to the court directly implicating young people when so many state and local lawmakers are legislating with morality and young people on their minds.‚Äù

The Supreme Court added to its ‚Äúteenager term‚Äù on Wednesday by agreeing to hear arguments in the fast-moving challenge to the widely bipartisan TikTok ban President Joe Biden signed in April. The law followed years of concern that TikTok‚Äôs Chinese parent company poses a national security risk. It would allow TikTok to continue to operate in the US if its US-based subsidiary makes a clean break from Chinese ownership.

Affected but voiceless

Pediatricians and other experts have for years warned about the potential harms of social media for teenagers, but it was national security ‚Äî not social science ‚Äî that ostensibly prompted Congress to approve the TikTok ban. Because of that, the questions now pending at the Supreme Court don‚Äôt deal with how young people interact with the app, even though they will be most affected by the court‚Äôs decision.

The ban is set to take effect January 19.

‚ÄúThe court, I don‚Äôt think, is thinking of this in terms of children,‚Äù said Leslie Y. Garfield Tenzer, a law professor at Pace University who focuses on social media.

‚ÄúWe all think of TikTok as being essential to teens and content creation ‚Äî and Ariana Grande doing the ‚ÄòWicked‚Äô dance and everyone mimicking it ‚Äî but the reason that the ban is in place is not because of that type of content,‚Äù Tenzer said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because of the fear that the People‚Äôs Republic of China can manipulate us.‚Äù

That disconnect between the legal questions raised in the case and the potential impact on young people and their parents is a theme that runs through several of the major cases this term. A majority of the court‚Äôs justices signaled this month they are prepared to back a divisive Tennessee law that bans gender-affirming care for minors. Much of that argument on December 4 focused on whether courts should defer to state lawmakers in making those difficult choices. Far less time was spent on the transgender minors who have described the care as essential.

The court notably declined to consider a question about whether parents have a right to direct care for their children.

A case pending about the Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs effort to yank vaping products from shelves, meanwhile, has less to do with the health risks for youth than with whether the agency followed the proper legal protocols when it stepped in to regulate the multibillion-dollar industry. Nineteen percent of high school students vaped in 2020, the FDA says, a far higher share than that of students who smoked.

At the center of both disputes are questions about whether state lawmakers and agencies overstepped when they enacted policies they say are necessary to protect young people. At least one conservative ‚Äî Justice Clarence Thomas ‚Äî appeared potentially persuaded by Tennessee‚Äôs argument that its transgender care ban applies to people based on age rather that sex and on their medical choices ‚Äî a distinction that would make it easier for the state to defend the law in federal court.

‚ÄúSo why isn‚Äôt this simply a case of age classification when it comes to these treatments as opposed to a ban?‚Äù Thomas asked the attorney for the Biden administration.

Texas is making similar arguments in a case the court is set to hear next month concerning a state law that requires age verification for sexually explicit web sites. Opponents, including the porn industry, say the law violates the First Amendment by making it harder for adults to access adult content online. But supporters say the law is first and foremost about safeguarding minors.

‚ÄúTexas seeks to protect kids from some of the most prurient sexual content imaginable,‚Äù attorneys for the state wrote in court papers. ‚ÄúTexas has addressed only websites dedicated to pornography, has allowed them to comply by using common age-verification technology, and has not imposed criminal penalties. Such a modest but important law satisfies any level of scrutiny.‚Äù

Disillusionment with SCOTUS

Because of the way lawsuits move through the federal judiciary, the Supreme Court is limited in how it frames its cases and who is heard. While the justices did not grant a separate appeal from the transgender minors and their families affected by Tennessee‚Äôs ban, the court did allow their attorney to present arguments earlier this month.

Still, experts say the cases that will affect teenagers that are now pending give attention to young people only secondarily.

‚ÄúThe court isn‚Äôt directly evaluating what it thinks will be best for young people,‚Äù Tang said. ‚ÄúThe court is evaluating whether state lawmakers ‚Äî or the FDA, in the vaping case ‚Äî were correct in their assessment of what would be best for young people.‚Äù

That worries advocates who work with teenagers, who fear that some of the most contentious fights playing out in Congress and statehouses across the country are more about politics than they are about protecting minors. A Gallup-Walton Family Foundation survey from earlier this year found that 44% of voting-age members of Gen Z said they trust the Supreme Court ‚Äúvery little,‚Äù while 20% said they had ‚Äúquite a lot‚Äù or ‚Äúa great deal‚Äù of trust in the court.

‚ÄúWhat we have heard from them is an increase in distrust and an increase in disillusionment with government institutions,‚Äù said Diana Thu-Thao Rhodes, a vice president at Advocates for Youth, a reproductive and sexual rights organization.

‚ÄúThe impact is directly on young people,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand yet we don‚Äôt necessarily hear the voices of young people.‚Äù

Spencer Rahim, also a high school junior from Virginia, said that most teenagers he knows manage to find ways around the concerns many have about TikTok. Some, for instance, simply avoid posting personal material.

‚ÄúTo me,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not really that big of a concern.‚Äù

Less certain for Rahim, however, is how the justices will tackle the issue.

‚ÄúThey need to listen to the people a little bit more,‚Äù he said.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.6824271082878113,neutral,0.7690219879150391,Neutral

The clock is ticking for American creators who say they are both nervous and frustrated as they prepare for a potential nationwide ban of TikTok next month.

A bipartisan bill President Joe Biden signed this year requires TikTok‚Äôs Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the platform to an American company or face a ban ‚Äî which is set to take effect Jan. 19, the day before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The Supreme Court said it will take up TikTok‚Äôs appeal on Jan. 10.

‚ÄúSo many people have found connection, communities, and people‚Äôs livelihoods now have been built from TikTok,‚Äù said Jenn Ficarra, a Los Angeles-based writer who used TikTok to help launch a baby-name consulting business as a side hustle. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just really dismayed and annoyed and angry that something that is instrumental to so many people‚Äôs livelihoods is being stripped away.‚Äù

Lawmakers who pushed for a ban argue that TikTok‚Äôs Chinese owner poses a national security threat to the United States. But for many American creators who‚Äôve come to rely on it as their main source of income, losing it would mean scrambling for new ways to sustain their careers and rebuild their personal brands.

In recent weeks, hundreds of TikTok users like Ficcarra have lamented the looming ban, posting videos showcasing their anxiety, anger and grief as they prepare to lose access to it.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to have to be sacrifices made, and it obviously does make me worry about everyday life, like groceries, rent, all those sorts of stuff,‚Äù said Jonathan Miller, a songwriter and music commentator who has been a full-time creator since 2010.

Creators like Miller ‚Äî who have amassed followings on TikTok but aren‚Äôt necessarily considered household names ‚Äî hope to pivot to other platforms to make up for the income they expect to lose from the potential ends of their TikTok careers.

In a court filing this month, TikTok claimed U.S. small businesses and social media creators would lose $1.3 billion in earnings within just a month of a shutdown.

TikTok is the most commonly used platform by brands that engage in influencer marketing, according to a recent report by the Influencer Marketing Hub, which also found that 50% of influencer marketers believe TikTok delivers the best return on investment for short-form video content. It has become a giant in the evolving creator economy, which includes millions of social media personalities who make money through brand deals, platform monetization and audience subscriptions. Research from Goldman Sachs last year predicted that the total market opportunity of the creator economy could reach $480 billion by 2027.

Cole Mason, a co-founder of the creator marketing company Pearpop, said he‚Äôs optimistic creators will adapt should there be a ban.

‚ÄúCreators will be a powerful force behind our culture, with or without TikTok,‚Äù he said in an email. ‚ÄúUltimately, where creatives go, audiences and brands follow.‚Äù

As they gear up for the reality of losing part of their regular incomes, some TikTok creators have already gotten started on building their followings elsewhere.

Miller, who has around 230,000 TikTok followers, said he makes the majority of his income through TikTok‚Äôs Creator Fund (which pays based on views and engagement) and livestreams. Anticipating a ban, he has been using his TikTok page to cross-promote his YouTube and Instagram accounts. He plans to test new types of content to better cater to those platforms.

Fashion and beauty creator Kalita Hon, who said about 70% of her income comes from TikTok, mainly through brand deals, has a similar strategy. She said she plans to shift her focus to Instagram Reels, with the hope that fashion brands are more likely to move there, as well, in the wake of a ban.

But she said she doesn‚Äôt expect to bring her 245,000 TikTok followers with her, because the audience is ‚Äúvery specific‚Äù to that platform.

‚ÄúTikTok has so much culture that‚Äôs so specific to the app, because there are certain videos that will go insanely viral and then that will become, like, the next inside joke,‚Äù Hon said.

Some creators, like Taylor Pare, argue that if a ban does go into effect, creators whose income came primarily from TikTok should be entitled to unemployment benefits. The app accounts for roughly 90% to 95% of her income, she said.

‚ÄúPerhaps if you‚Äôre making millions of dollars you‚Äôre probably set, but I think there‚Äôs people that really rely on this and they‚Äôve made this their job,‚Äù said Pare, a full-time TikTok creator who has built an audience of more than 90,000 followers talking about dating in New York City. ‚ÄúAnd if the government feels that we‚Äôre not allowed to have this, I feel like there needs to be some compensation or stimulus financially.‚Äù

There has also been early buzz around possible replacements for TikTok. Some creators and users have mentioned several emerging apps ‚Äî such as Clapper and a yet-to-launch app called Neptune ‚Äî as options.

Though Neptune has been in the works only since May, its CEO, Ashley Darling, said the sudden ‚Äúmass panic and hysteria‚Äù over TikTok‚Äôs looming ban injected so much user interest in the new app that her team is pushing up its release date to next spring, with beta testing to begin as early as January.

Mason, of Pearpop, said that ‚Äúthe creator economy rewards versatile talent.‚Äù

If the government feels that we‚Äôre not allowed to have this, I feel like there needs to be some compensation or stimulus financially. ‚Äî Tiktok creator Taylor Pare

‚ÄúThe TikTok ban, should it go into effect, will only be the latest in a long history of reinvention by creators and digital marketers,‚Äù he said, adding later in his email that ‚Äúbefore the rise of TikTok, we saw the rise and fall of Dubsmash, Vine, and countless other platforms, without any U.S. regulatory action. The same community that weathers sudden algorithm changes, the switch from long-form to short-form video, and a trend cycle that transforms by the minute can navigate a TikTok ban.‚Äù

Still, some, like Hon, are skeptical of any TikTok copycats.

‚ÄúI think, if anything, people will just migrate to apps that are already established and have that notoriety,‚Äù she said.

Because a ban would primarily affect American TikTok users, the only people who‚Äôd have incentives to join a new app would be Americans, Hon said, with the possible addition of non-American users who hope to re-follow their favorite creators there.

Others, like Ficarra, anticipate the challenges they‚Äôd have shifting gears ‚Äî but said they feel it would open up fresh opportunities for smaller creators.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid of the hard work that it‚Äôs going to take, because I obviously did that with my business,‚Äù Ficarra said. ‚ÄúAnd I think there‚Äôs something exciting about a new platform coming along.‚Äù

For Miller, joining a new app would feel like d√©j√† vu of the years before TikTok, when other platforms like Vine were the go-tos.

‚ÄúWe all moved to TikTok. We all moved to YouTube. We all moved to Instagram. ... I joined BlueSky, which is kind of slowly replacing Twitter, maybe,‚Äù Miller said. ‚ÄúSo if the right platform comes around, why not?‚Äù",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.2389752268791198,neutral,0.4786935150623321,Anti-ban

By HALELUYA HADERO, Associated Press

President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a ‚Äúpolitical resolution‚Äù to the issue.

The request came as TikTok and the Biden administration filed opposing briefs to the court, in which the company argued the court should strike down a law that could ban the platform by Jan. 19 while the government emphasized its position that the statute is needed to eliminate a national security risk.

‚ÄúPresident Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the Court consider staying the Act‚Äôs deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,‚Äù said Trump‚Äôs amicus brief, which supported neither party in the case and was written by D. John Sauer, Trump‚Äôs choice for solicitor general.

The argument submitted to the court is the latest example of Trump inserting himself in national issues before he takes office. The Republican president-elect has already begun negotiating with other countries over his plans to impose tariffs, and he intervened earlier this month in a plan to fund the federal government, calling for a bipartisan plan to be rejected and sending Republicans back to the negotiating table.

He has been holding meetings with foreign leaders and business officials at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida while he assembles his administration, including a meeting last week with TikTok CEO Shou Chew.

Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined the TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral.

He said earlier this year that he still believed there were national security risks with TikTok, but that he opposed banning it.

The filings Friday come ahead of oral arguments scheduled for Jan. 10 on whether the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban, unlawfully restricts speech in violation of the First Amendment. The law was was signed by President Joe Biden in April after it passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge afterwards.

Earlier this month, a panel of three federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the statute, leading TikTok to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.

The brief from Trump said he opposes banning TikTok at this junction and ‚Äúseeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.‚Äù

In their brief to the Supreme Court on Friday, attorneys for TikTok and its parent company ByteDance argued the federal appeals court erred in its ruling and based its decision on ‚Äúalleged ‚Äòrisks‚Äô that China could exercise control‚Äù over TikTok‚Äôs U.S. platform by pressuring its foreign affiliates.

The Biden administration has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok‚Äôs U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.

But the government ‚Äúconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,‚Äù TikTok‚Äôs legal filing said, adding that the U.S. fears are predicated on future risks.

In its filing Friday, the Biden administration said because TikTok ‚Äúis integrated with ByteDance and relies on its propriety engine developed and maintained in China,‚Äù its corporate structure carries with it risk.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.5040781497955322,neutral,0.9334190487861632,Anti-ban

President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs legal team asked the Supreme Court to halt a law requiring TikTok to be sold to an American company or shut down by January 19, the day before his inauguration. In a petition filed on Friday, the legal team argued that the incoming president should have the opportunity to ‚Äúresolve the issues at hand through political means‚Äù once he takes office.

While the brief did not directly address the legal question at hand‚Äîwhether banning the platform for the some 170 million Americans who use it violates their First Amendment rights to free speech‚Äîit noted that ‚Äúat this juncture,‚Äù Trump ‚Äúopposes banning TikTok in the United States.‚Äù

The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case earlier this month after a bipartisan measure‚Äîthe Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act‚Äîpassed Congress and was signed into law by President Joe Biden. The law cites national security concerns and would require TikTok‚Äôs Chinese owner, ByteDance, to either sell to an American company or face a ban.

‚ÄúPresident Trump alone possesses the consummate deal-making expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the government ‚Äî concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,‚Äù the brief, signed by Trump‚Äôs counsel and his pick for US solicitor general, D. John Sauer, reads.

TikTok‚Äôs legal team and the Biden administration also submitted briefs for the court to consider in the weeks leading up to oral arguments on January 10. TikTok argued that Congress signing the law was an ‚Äúunprecedented attempt to single out petitioners and bar them from operating one of the nation‚Äôs most significant speech venues‚Äù and was ‚Äúprofoundly unconstitutional.‚Äù They added that the government ‚Äúhas banned an extraordinary amount of speech‚Äù and ‚Äúgets facts wrong when it bothers to provide them.‚Äù

The Biden administration held that the law ‚Äúaddresses the serious threats to national security posed by the Chinese government‚Äôs control of TikTok, a platform that harvests sensitive data about tens of millions of Americans and would be a potent tool for covert influence operations by a foreign adversary.‚Äù

Another brief, filed on behalf of users of the service, acknowledged the ongoing geopolitical tension between China and the US, yet argued that allowing the law to take effect amounts to a ‚Äúsuppression of Americans‚Äô speech‚Äù and ‚Äúflies in the face of our history, tradition and precedent.‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs more recent support for the application is a shift from when, while still president in 2020, he unsuccessfully attempted to ban the platform, citing national security concerns. Federal courts halted his efforts.

Despite expressing disdain for the Chinese-owned app, he isn‚Äôt the only government leader who has used it to reach voters and campaign. According to an analysis by NBC News, 23 members of Congress who voted for the TikTok ban have verified accounts, and many of them use the platform to ‚Äúcampaign, defend their beliefs and curate their public image ‚Äî even as they argue that the app poses a threat to American users.‚Äù

As Vanity Fair‚Äôs Gabriel Sherman reported in March, Trump‚Äôs shift could be influenced by his complicated relationship with billionaire and mega-donor Jeff Yass. Yass, via Susquehanna International Group, put a few million dollars into ByteDance in 2012‚Äîan investment now worth some $40 billion, according to the Financial Times. The billionaire had previously urged Trump not to run and donated millions of dollars to his primary opponents, but with the former president‚Äôs electoral popularity and the growing threats to TikTok, Yass invited Trump to speak at a Club for Growth donor retreat at The Breakers in Palm Beach in March.

In June, Trump‚Äôs tone shift toward TikTok was evident when he posted his first video on the platform‚Äîa 13-second clip filmed at an Ultimate Fighting Championship event in Newark, NJ. Within a day, he had amassed millions of followers.

Trump, his team argued to the Supreme Court on Friday, is uniquely poised to handle this issue because of his history with social media.

‚ÄúPresident Trump is one of the most powerful, prolific and influential users of social media in history,‚Äù the brief said. ‚ÄúConsistent with his commanding presence in this area, President Trump currently has 14.7 million followers on TikTok with whom he actively communicates, allowing him to evaluate TikTok‚Äôs importance as a unique medium for freedom of expression, including core political speech.‚Äù

Trump has used his TikTok account to, amongst other things, encourage his supporters to stay in line on Election Day, share videos of him with YouTube star Logan Paul and his brother, professional boxer and influencer Jake Paul, promote his campaign stunt of working at a McDonald‚Äôs, and post supercuts of his hate-filled rally in Madison Square Garden.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.2045742869377136,neutral,0.9246549010276794,Anti-ban

President-elect Donald Trump says he is uniquely positioned to negotiate a deal resolving national-security issues and other problems with TikTok and on Friday asked the Supreme Court to stay a ban on the social media site that is scheduled to take effect on Jan. 19. File Pool Photo by Spencer Platt/UPI | License Photo

Dec. 28 (UPI) -- President-elect Donald Trump intervened in the Supreme Court case that ultimately could decide whether a federal ban on TikTok occurs.

Attorney John Sauer filed a 25-page brief Friday requesting the Supreme Court to consider whether the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act violates the First Amendment.

""President Trump is one of the most powerful, prolific and influential users of social media in history,"" Sauer said.

Trump has 14.7 million followers on TikTok, which he says allows him to ""evaluate TikTok's importance as a unique medium for freedom of expression, including core political speech,"" he argues.

Sauer said Trump and ""his rival"" used TikTok to connect with voters during the 2024 election cycle.

""As this court instructs, the First Amendment's 'constitutional guarantee has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office,'"" Sauer said.

The brief said 170 million Americans use TikTok, and the president and vice president are the only elected officials who represent all of the nation's voters.

Trump also owns the social media site Truth Social, which Sauer says, ""gives him an in-depth perspective on the extraordinary government power attempted to be exercised in this case.""

He said that government power is to ""effectively shut down a social media platform favored by tens of millions of Americans based in large part on concerns about disfavored content on that platform.""

Sauer cites Brazilian officials banning X for more than a month earlier in 2024 due to political speech on that social media site as an example of government interference with free speech.

""President Trump alone possesses the consummate deal-making expertise, the electoral mandate and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the government,"" Sauer says.

Trump acknowledges those concerns, but the 270-day federal deadline for TikTok to sell its U.S. interests or be shut down expires on Jan.19, while Trump is scheduled to be sworn in on Jan. 20.

""This unfortunate timing interferes with President Trump's ability to ... pursue a resolution to both protect national security and save a social media platform that provides a popular vehicle for 170 million Americans to exercise their core First Amendment rights,"" Sauer says.

The brief asks the court to stay the TikTok deadline to enable Trump's incoming administration to negotiate a resolution to the matter.

At least one critic said Trump's interest in the matter is more personal rather than policy-driven.

""With Donald Trump, it's always some combination of two things,"" Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., told CNN host Jim Sciutto on Friday, The Hill reported.

""It's, one, flattery and inflating his ego. And then number two is the soft corruption and sycophancy of his inner circle,"" Auchincloss said. ""Those two threads can intertwine, and they can change American policy.""

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments regarding the pending TikTok ban on Jan. 10 and whether or not Chinese firm ByteDance must sell the social media company to a U.S. firm or be banned on Jan. 19.

U.S. lawmakers and officials have accused ByteDance of being influenced by the Chinese government, which its owners have denied.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.1986591815948486,neutral,0.908961057662964,Anti-ban

What started as a COVID-19 side project for Arlee Tenpas has grown into a full-fledged business with a loyal online following and orders coming in by the hour.

Minneapolis-based Cheerware, an online retailer that sells custom glassware and apparel, is a small but mighty operation with more than 15,000 products sold thanks to the creativity of owner Tenpas and the TikTok algorithm.

A Lake Elmo native, 31-year-old Tenpas was working in marketing and product development for a beverage company in Chicago when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

‚ÄúI was spending way too much time on TikTok seeing other people do creative side projects and I thought I could do that and maybe even do it better,‚Äù Tenpas said.

Cheerware products range from drinking glasses, diner mugs and reusable glass straws to T-shirts, shorts, sweatshirts and bags.

The goal of Cheerware? ‚ÄúTo make something simple and everyday a bit more exciting and magical,‚Äù Tenpas said.

Each of the Cheerware designs, which range from quaint European village streets and lilypad-hopping frogs to pop culture nods like Zelda video game characters or lyrics from pop artist Chappell Roan, are created by Tenpas.

‚Äú(The designs) make very specific people super happy,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not for everyone, but the people who love it, really love it.‚Äù

A small operation, Tenpas employs one studio assistant and a customer service representative and turns to her community when a product goes viral or a big order comes in.

After leaving Chicago in 2023, Tenpas briefly worked from Lake Elmo with the help of her family before moving into her current studio in Northeast Minneapolis.

Rest assured, the business‚Äôs east metro connections are still strong with its apparel embroidered by Shirt Werks in Eagan. And only weeks ago, Cheerware made its Twin Cities pop-up debut in St. Paul at St. Anthony Park‚Äôs Milton Square.

Getting noticed

After some initial success selling her products on Etsy in the spring of 2020, Tenpas decided to level up with a bit of help.

Elsie Tenpas, a web designer and the sibling of Arlee Tenpas, decided to gift her sister something every small business owner dreams of: a custom website.

To kick off the website launch in the fall of 2020, Tenpas debuted a Halloween collection complete with friendly ghosts and crisp autumn leaves that quickly went viral.

The United States and China are locked in a faceoff over tariffs. No one wants to blink first ‚ÄúEvery second there was an order coming through,‚Äù Tenpas said. With some 500,000 views of the collection on TikTok, the website broke.

‚ÄúHer business took off so fast that the site we built had trouble keeping up,‚Äù Elsie Tenpas said. ‚ÄúBecause she was blowing up online, there were people from all over the world trying to buy Cheerware and we hadn‚Äôt even set up global shipping options.‚Äù

After some tweaks that included ‚Äúmaking code up on the fly,‚Äù Cheerware was off and running, her sister said.

Shortly after the Halloween collection launched, Tenpas quit her job and started running Cheerware full-time out of the second bedroom in her Chicago apartment.

‚ÄòBuilt with TikTok‚Äô

Cheerware currently has more than 50,000 followers on TikTok with more than 810,000 views across its videos.

‚ÄúThe business was built with TikTok,‚Äù Tenpas said, and its following is growing by the day. ‚ÄúWhen we are launching something, we‚Äôll partner with influencers and sometimes their videos get a lot of traction.‚Äù

For the Zelda-themed Hylian Collection launch in 2023, Cheerware partnered with ‚ÄúCozy Games and Lifestyle‚Äù influencer Wisteriem, who garnered more than 1.2 million views for Cheerware products on just two posts.

Social media consultant Arik Hanson said while there is value in selling merchandise on TikTok, ‚ÄúThere is a lot of value in working with creators and influencers because that‚Äôs how we‚Äôre seeing younger people buy merchandise and products ‚Äì on social media.‚Äù

Other Cheerware partnerships include Knock.Thrice, an embroidery and apparel business popular on TikTok, and XO Marshmallow Cafe in Chicago.

‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre small, it is just your work that speaks for you,‚Äù Tenpas said. ‚ÄúSo when larger businesses repost (your content), it is huge exposure and that stuff happens because of the algorithm.‚Äù

This time last year, Tenpas said 90% of her business came from TikTok, but as the federal government attempts to ban the social media platform, she‚Äôs preparing for what comes next.

Time running out on TikTok?

A law enacted in April set a Jan. 19 deadline for ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, to either sell the app or face a ban in the U.S. due to alleged threats to national security.

With some 72,000 Minnesota businesses using TikTok to sell and market their products, it‚Äôs easy to see why there are concerns about the impending ban.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking about banning a cultural touchstone of the U.S. economy, basically,‚Äù said Hanson, who also teaches social media courses at the University of Minnesota and University of St. Thomas.

‚ÄúIf it gets banned that‚Äôs huge news, not just for marketing but for the culture in general,‚Äù Hanson said, adding that he would be surprised if it does get banned.

Three quick tips

Social media consultant Arik Hanson noted three actionable steps small business owners can take to prepare for a potential TikTok ban:

Develop a contingency plan Save your TikTok content Reserve your business‚Äôs handles on emerging platforms

One third of small- to mid-size businesses in Minnesota said TikTok is ‚Äúcritical‚Äù to their business with over 90% reporting an increase in sales after promoting their products and services on the app, according to a recent TikTok consumer report conducted by Oxford Economics.

In Minnesota, small- to mid-size business use of TikTok supported over 4,000 jobs and contributed $430 million to the state‚Äôs GDP in 2023, per the report.

The Supreme Court recently said it would hear arguments on Jan. 10 regarding the constitutionality of the federal law that could ban TikTok. President-elect Donald Trump on Friday asked the court to consider pausing the ban until his administration can pursue a ‚Äúpolitical resolution.‚Äù

Still, some small business owners like Tenpas aren‚Äôt wasting time.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm planning for TikTok to not exist,‚Äù Tenpas said.

While Cheerware is still posting on TikTok, Tenpas is turning to other means of exposure like YouTube, Patreon and an emailed newsletter with 15,000 subscribers to ‚Äúnurture my existing audience,‚Äù she said, but they are not without their troubles.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs harder to create content when it‚Äôs long-form,‚Äù Tenpas said, as compared to TikTok or Instagram. ‚ÄúYou not only have to run the business, you have to record the experience of it for the internet.‚Äù

This year, 70% of Cheerware‚Äôs sales came from online and the other 30% from wholesale to coffee shops, bookstores and boutiques.

What‚Äôs next?

With a larger Minneapolis studio to grow into, Tenpas has no shortage of ideas on what to do next from pop-up markets to new designs and product development.

In addition to creating the designs for already existing products, Tenpas said she is looking forward to creating her own products.

One product currently in development is a new type of lid for her drinkware glasses that she said she has yet to see elsewhere on the market.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really happy that this is what I get to do ‚Äì making something ordinary a bright spot of your day,‚Äù Tenpas said.

Cadbury brand chocolates have borne an image of the Royal Arms for 170 years, but in recent days, King Charles III has ended that candy‚Äôs reign. In a shakeup that‚Äôs surprised much of Britain, Charles has pulled Cadbury‚Äôs royal warrant, an honor intended to indicate that the company is a supplier to England‚Äôs ruling family. The brand, a favorite of Queen Victoria‚Äôs, is now out in the cold, as is Unilever, the vast British conglomerate that owns companies including Ben & Jerry‚Äôs ice cream, the Axe fragrance (?) line, and self-proclaimed ‚Äúcosmetics cop‚Äù Paula Begoun‚Äôs skincare line.

As Buckingham Palace explains, royal warrants (full name: royal marks of appointment) are ‚Äúa mark of recognition to people or companies who have regularly supplied goods or services to the Royal Household.‚Äù It‚Äôs a distinction granted to about 800 companies and makers from around the globe, giving them the right to display the royal family‚Äôs Coat of Arms in relation to its business. Typically, you‚Äôll see it on packaging, a company website, or on its delivery vehicles; as you can imagine, strict rules exist about its display and use.

But similar to a Michelin star, this isn‚Äôt a lifetime approval. ‚ÄúWarrants may not be renewed if the quality or supply for the product or service is insufficient,‚Äù Buckingham Palace notes, and it ‚Äúmay be cancelled at any time and is automatically reviewed if the Grantee dies or leaves the business, or if the firm goes bankrupt or is sold.‚Äù

It‚Äôs unclear how Cadbury ran afoul of King Charles, who announced the second set of warrants earlier this month after his coronation in 2023. Conspicuous in its absence from the list (which can be read in full online) were Cadbury, which was first granted its warrant in 1854, and Unilever, a warrant-holder since 2016.

Both Unilever and Cadbury‚Äôs parent company, Chicago-based Mondelez International, have been the focus of boycotts and ban campaigns in recent years, over the companies‚Äô business ties with Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Groups including the International Partnership for Human Rights, sent an open letter to Charles this summer, asking specifically that he ‚Äúrevoke the Royal Warrants from all warrant-holding companies that are continuing their operations in Russia,‚Äù as doing so would show that ‚Äúthat companies contributing to the suffering and devastation in Ukraine will not be bestowed with the privilege and honour of holding a Royal Warrant.‚Äù

According to the Independent, the issue might be less about politics and more about the planet. Charles is known as an environmental crusader and a fan of organic and sustainable food, both interests that seem at odds with multinational corporations focused on ultra-processed goods. That might be why, as the paper puts it, ‚Äúthe supply of Cadbury products to royal households has decreased in recent years.‚Äù (The late Queen Elizabeth, we should note, was known as a fan of the company‚Äôs Bournville dark chocolate bar.)

Speaking with the BBC, Birmingham Business School professor David Bailey notes that being dropped from the list isn't just a status thing, and can have a real impact on a company's bottom line. Costs following the change will include redesigns for packaging to remove the insignia from all goods, as well as across-the-board revisions to advertising and marketing materials.

Via statement, Unilever said it is ‚Äúvery proud of the long history our brands have supplying the royal household and of the warrants they have been awarded during this time, most recently by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II,‚Äù but did not respond to questions regarding its business in Russia.

Mondelez‚Äôs response on behalf of Cadbury was slightly more pointed, ‚ÄúWhilst we are disappointed to be one of hundreds of other businesses and brands in the UK to not have a new warrant awarded, we are proud to have previously held one, and we fully respect the decision.‚Äù",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.8826530575752258,neutral,0.5508427619934082,Neutral

This is specifically for Australians but anyone can read it.

I've noticed that there has been a lot of misunderstanding about what the social media ban is, how it will work, and when it will be implemented.

First things first, the ban will start at the _end_ of 2025, not at the start. A lot of people haven't realised this so it's the first thing I wanted to cover.

The ban only includes; Tiktok, Snapchat, Instagram, X, Facebook, and Reddit. It does not include YouTube and messaging apps. People under 16 will not be allowed to grandfather their accounts and theoretically will be forced to delete the apps. The government understands that there will be people who find their way around the ban and there will be no reprocissions for those who do or their parents.

_How_ the age verification will work is still unknown. The law was rushed and only recently passed so they haven't figured everything out yet. The earliest the law can come in is in December of 2025 but if they haven't finished everything by then, it will be delayed.

By MAE ANDERSON, AP Business Writer

A looming TikTok ban could affect the millions of small businesses that use the short-video social media app to help them grow their business.

Desiree Hill, owner of Crown‚Äôs Corner Mechanic in Conyers, Georgia, started her business solo as a mobile mechanic. Sharing videos of her work on TikTok helped spread the word and she became so popular she was able to open a 9,000 square foot brick and mortar shop with five employees 18 months ago.

‚ÄúEvery day I get at least two to three customers that have seen me on TikTok, watched my videos and wanted to become a customer,‚Äù she said.

Though TikTok has been around only since 2016, small business owners use the platform in a variety of ways, from growing a customer base to advertising and marketing, as well as selling goods directly from the site.

According to TikTok‚Äôs own estimates, small businesses on TikTok would lose more than $1 billion in revenue in a single month if the ban goes into effect.

The Justice Department ordered the app‚Äôs China-based parent company, ByteDance, to sell TikTok or face a U.S. ban by Jan. 19, citing security concerns. The Supreme Court will take up the matter in January. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has asked the Supreme Court for a delay.

If a ban does occur, small businesses will have to migrate to other platforms to find their customers. Instagram Reels, SnapChat and YouTube Shorts are alternatives. The good news is brands likely already have a presence there. But it may be harder to reach teens that have made TikTok their preferred social media app.

‚ÄúI am worried because there is no preparation for this,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt holds such a significant place in regards to my customer base and how I reach customers that if I lose TikTok, I will lose a large part of my business or I will lose my ability to grow anymore.‚Äù

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

As we enter the new year, dockets are filling up with blockbuster court cases in the US.

Criminal courts in Manhattan are preparing for the trial of rap mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs and early hearings in the prosecution of Luigi Mangione, who is accused of the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

In the civil arena, lawyers are gearing up for a year of antitrust lawsuits brought by the DOJ against Big Tech, Visa, and other companies it accuses of monopolizing their industries.

While 2024 was the year of Donald Trump in court, there's still much to be done in the coming year as his fight to clear his rap sheet and zero out his civil judgments continues.

Here are some of the cases Business Insider will be watching this year:

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs cases

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs ‚Äî founder of Bad Boy Records and the Sean John brand ‚Äî is due to stand trial in federal court in Manhattan on May 5 on a sex-trafficking indictment that could send him to prison for life. Prosecutors have also warned that a second indictment is imminent.

Given what's already in the record, trial testimony and evidence will be graphic, and the courtroom jousting will be heated. Combs' defense is that he never forced anyone to have sex, and that his accusers have financial motive to implicate him. The trial will likely focus on consent and credibility.

Combs' mother and his six oldest children ‚Äî who range from teenagers to early 30s ‚Äî have attended pretrial hearings, waving and smiling at him from the audience. The trial may prove less family-friendly. The evidence includes hundreds of hours of videotape from the rap mogul's sex parties ‚Äî especially from his so-called freak-off performances, along with testimony by male sex workers who attended the parties. The trial will not be televised.

Separately, Combs faces more than 30 civil lawsuits accusing him of sexual abuse. ""No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won't change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted, or sex trafficked anyone,"" his attorneys recently said in a statement.

Luigi Mangione court case

Luigi Mangione, a 26-year-old software developer from a Maryland real estate family, will face state and federal murder charges in Manhattan this year in the December ambush shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. He risks a maximum sentence of life in prison and, in the federal case, the death penalty ‚Äî though it has been more than 60 years since a Manhattan jury has sent anyone to death row.

Both the state and federal prosecutions are in their early days. While Mangione has pleaded not guilty in his state case, he is not set to enter a plea to his federal indictment until later this month.

It's possible Mangione will go to trial in 2025, though it's unlikely. His attorney suggested prior to taking the case that he could pursue some kind of psychiatric defense, which could delay the trial into 2026.

The president-elect's criminal indictments have sputtered to a halt, thanks in large part to the US Supreme Court's July presidential immunity decision. Loose ends remain in the Manhattan hush-money case, as Trump works to clear his rap sheet of its sole conviction before his January 20 inauguration.

There is still no sentencing date, and New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan has yet to rule on Trump's demand that the case be tossed in the interest of justice, given the election. Also pending is Trump's Second Circuit appellate efforts to move the hush-money case to federal court.

Meanwhile, Trump begins 2025 with a half-billion-dollars in civil court judgments hanging over his head, all of which he's in the midst of aggressively appealing, including his two E. Jean Carroll defamation cases. A midlevel New York appellate court could keep, trim, or overturn the biggest of Trump's judgments at any time ‚Äî his massive civil fraud penalty, a debt to New York state that remains frozen on appeal, which has now ballooned to $490 million with interest. He remains a defendant in eight civil cases brought by injured Capitol Police officers and members of Congress involving his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection.

TikTok ban

In the spring, Congress passed a law that would ban TikTok from app stores in the United States unless Bytedance, the platform's Chinese owner, divested itself from the app.

The deadline is January 19. Bytedance still owns TikTok. A Washington, DC-based appeals court was unpersuaded by TikTok's arguments that its users' First Amendment rights outweigh the national security-based reasoning of Congress's law.

All eyes are on the US Supreme Court to see whether it will strike down the law before the deadline. The court agreed to hear oral arguments in the case on January 10.

Nvidia

The Justice Department has reportedly been ramping up an antitrust investigation into the chipmaker throughout 2024. Competitors have said Nvidia uses unfair marketing tactics to gain a stranglehold on the market for chips used in AI development, while the company says it simply offers a best-in-class product. If the DOJ brings a lawsuit or comes to a settlement with Nvidia, it'll likely come in 2025.

Meta antitrust lawsuit

The Federal Trade Commission sued Meta during the first Trump administration, alleging it had an illegal monopoly on the social media market through its ownership of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The Biden administration has kept up the lawsuit, which scored a major victory in November when a federal judge allowed most of the case to go to trial.

Meta says the company's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram have been good for consumers. If it loses the trial ‚Äî scheduled for April ‚Äî the FTC will seek to force the company to divest from Instagram and WhatsApp.

Google antitrust lawsuit

Google search case

Alphabet was dealt a major blow in 2024 when a federal judge concluded Google formed an illegal monopoly in the search market. Now the company is tussling with the Justice Department over how it should be punished. Google suggested it could pull back some of its partnerships with other companies. The DOJ has asked the judge to force Google to divest from its Chrome browser, a more dramatic move. The decision ‚Äî and the many appeals to come ‚Äî will continue to play out in 2025.

Google advertising case

Another major Google antitrust case is over its role in online advertising. In September, a federal court held a bench trial to determine whether the company formed another illegal monopoly, in the adtech market.

Google claims the Justice Department has overstated its role in the market, where it competes fiercely with the likes of Meta and Amazon.

A decision is expected to come sometime in 2025, with appeals to follow.

Amazon's antitrust trial is expected in 2026. Amazon

Amazon antitrust lawsuit

In 2023, the Federal Trade Commission and a group of states sued Amazon, alleging it abused its dominance in the online retail space to inflate prices, squeeze third-party sellers with onerous fees, and push its in-house products at the expense of others. Amazon has said it does everything for the benefit of consumers, to whom it provides better products and better prices.

In September, a federal judge knocked down some of the states' claims but allowed the bulk of the lawsuit to proceed to trial. The trial date is scheduled for 2026, with more litigation and appeals expected to take place before then.

OpenAI faces a lawsuit by The New York Times. NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images

New York Times vs OpenAI

All sorts of content creators ‚Äî journalists, novelists, filmmakers, photographers ‚Äî have filed a slew of copyright lawsuits against AI companies, accusing them of illegally siphoning their creations to train their AI models.

The AI companies have generally argued that the use of the material is sufficiently ""transformative"" to be considered ""fair use"" under copyright law.

One of the major cases to watch is The New York Times's lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, which has progressed further than many of the other cases. In January, a federal judge is scheduled to oversee a marathon day of oral arguments over whether the case is on firm enough legal ground to proceed to trial.

Elon Musk vs Sam Altman and OpenAI

In the past few years, OpenAI has become a tech behemoth, setting the pace for generative artificial intelligence technology.

The company is technically structured as a nonprofit that seeks to build artificial intelligence in a way that benefits all of humanity. However, under its leader Sam Altman, OpenAI has signed a lucrative deal with Microsoft, which hopes to harness the tech to drive its own growth.

Now OpenAI is trying to formally convert itself into a for-profit company, shedding the nonprofit label. Musk ‚Äî who was involved in OpenAI's early stages and who runs a competitor, xAI ‚Äî is trying to stop that from happening.

The case has been moving at a fast clip, with lawyers for Musk and OpenAI dropping legal filings that reveal internal emails and other records about the other. It's set to continue heating up in 2025 as OpenAI tries to become a corporation.

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan accused New York City Mayor Eric Adams of taking bribes from Turkey to fuel his political career ‚Äî charges that he has strenuously denied. Adams hired Alex Spiro, a hard-charging lawyer best known for representing Musk, to fight the cases. The case is on the fast track and is expected to go to trial in April, before the city's Democratic primary.

An initial pretrial conference in the antitrust lawsuit against Apple is scheduled in February. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images

DOJ's Apple antitrust lawsuit

The Justice Department sued Apple in March, accusing it of violating antitrust laws by illegally maintaining a smartphone monopoly. More than a dozen states have since joined the lawsuit against the tech giant, and the initial conference in the case will be held on February 27 in federal court in Newark, New Jersey.

The DOJ accuses Apple of making its rivals' products worse by selectively imposing contractual restrictions on developers and by withholding critical access points from them.

Apple does this, according to the Justice Department, by suppressing the development of cloud-streaming apps and services, worsening the quality of cross-platform messaging with rivals like Android, limiting the functionality of third-party smartwatches unless the owners keep buying iPhones, blocking the development of ""super apps,"" and limiting functions on non-Apple wallet tap-to-pay.

Apple previously told Business Insider that if the lawsuit was successful, it could set a dangerous precedent by ""empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people's technology.""

""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,"" Apple said in a March 2024 statement to BI. ""If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple ‚Äî where hardware, software, and services intersect.""

Live Nation Ticketmaster lawsuit

A little over a year after the historic Ticketmaster crash, which prevented Taylor Swift fans from purchasing Eras tour tickets, the Justice Department in May sued Live Nation, the website's parent company.

Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know

The DOJ accuses Live Nation of unlawfully dominating the live music market, stifling innovation, and exerting control over how fans can purchase tickets and where artists can perform. It seeks to break up the company.

A final pretrial conference is scheduled for February 12 in federal court in Manhattan, but the case isn't expected to go to trial until early 2026.

Live Nation previously told BI in a statement that the lawsuit would fail in court.

""The DOJ's lawsuit won't solve the issues fans care about relating to ticket prices, service fees, and access to in-demand shows,"" the company said in May.

An antitrust lawsuit brought by the DOJ says Visa handled more than 60% of US debit transactions, earning the company more than $7 billion in fees a year. Visa

Visa antitrust lawsuit

The Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Visa in September, accusing the company of engaging in anticompetitive behavior with its US debit transactions. Initial hearings in the case are expected in January.

The lawsuit accuses the payment-processing giant of entering into contracts with potential competitors that prevent them from becoming actual competitors. By doing so, Visa is able to collect fees that it wouldn't be able to in a competitive market, the Justice Department alleges.

The lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of New York, said Visa handled more than 60% of US debit transactions, earning the company more than $7 billion in fees a year.

In September, a lawyer for Visa told BI the lawsuit was ""meritless.""

""Today's lawsuit ignores the reality that Visa is just one of many competitors in a debit space that is growing, with entrants who are thriving,"" Julie Rottenberg said in a statement at the time.

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is scheduled for a January 3 contempt hearing. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images

Rudy Giuliani defamation case

This will be the fourth year for the court battle between Rudy Giuliani and Georgia election workers Wandrea ""Shaye"" Moss and Ruby Freeman.

The former Trump attorney and New York City mayor has owed Moss and Freeman $148 million since December 2023, after a DC judge found his repeated false accusations of election fraud subjected the mother-daughter pair to a barrage of racist death threats. The pair's lawyer complained in court recently that Giuliani has yet to turn over any assets beyond a handful of luxury watches, a Mercedes without a title, and a New York apartment without a current lease.

Giuliani now faces contempt of court for allegedly continuing to defame the pair on his nightly podcast and for what defense lawyers complain has been his heel-dragging in turning over assets and complying with subpoenas.

He is scheduled for a January 3 contempt hearing and a January 16 bench trial, both in federal court in Manhattan. The trial will determine if Giuliani must surrender his Palm Beach condo and three World Series rings.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.6954476833343506,neutral,0.8681032061576843,Neutral

Parents around the world are concerned about their children‚Äôs use of social media. But is there any way to control it?

Featured Video

Alongside the looming TikTok ban in the U.S., Australia passed legislation in November that bans children under 16 from using social media or creating new accounts.

Recent polls have shed light on just how much social media is intertwined with our lives, specifically for those ages 13-19. A Gallup poll showed that 51% of U.S. teenagers spend at least four hours on social media platforms each day.

On top of that, a poll conducted by the Pew Research Center indicated that 32% of teenage social media users reported that these social media platforms have a negative effect on their age demographic.

Social media usage among children and teens has sparked immense backlash. Per WebMD, teens‚Äô reports of persistent sadness and hopelessness increased 49% over the ten years from 2011 to 2021. Many argue that social media is to blame.

Now, some social media networks are shifting their platforms‚Äîand altering algorithms‚Äîto promote healthy use of the platforms among kids and teens.

Teen accounts are coming

Meta, the Mark Zuckerberg-steered social media company responsible for Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and Snapchat, is one company taking steps to combat the harms social media may have on children.

In September 2024, the company announced teen accounts, secured accounts are described by the brand as an easier way for users under the age of 18 to get accustomed to social media without the negative effects of being online.

Dr. Joanne Orlando, an expert in online wellness who holds a PhD in Digital Behavior, said the all-out social media ban for youngsters in Australia is extreme‚Äîand less likely to be effective.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too many ways to get around it. It‚Äôs too many complications,‚Äù Dr. Orlando told the Daily Dot in an interview. ‚ÄúI think that it is not the solution. It might be part of the solution, but it‚Äôs pretty easy for kids to get around it, and that makes it not a very viable legislation.‚Äù

One loophole, for example, is VPNs, a legal and simple way for prohibited social media users to be able to reach the prohibited platforms by simply changing their IP address to an allowed location.

While Meta‚Äôs teen accounts will have their own issues, including age verification, Dr. Orlando supports the effort.

‚ÄúI actually like that approach by Meta. I think if other platforms had that, I think that would be a better solution,‚Äù Dr. Orlando said.

‚ÄúIt just shows that there‚Äôs that phased-in approach of using social media, and I think that‚Äôs a good idea because right now a 13-year-old can sign up. They may have never used social media before and then bang, they‚Äôre right in the heat of social media and everything that it offers. So I think that phased in account, it‚Äôs almost an apprenticeship model.‚Äù

The controversial IG algorithm

Much of Meta‚Äôs controversy in the past stems from its social media platforms‚Äô algorithms. Instagram notes on its site that users‚Äô algorithms rank content in both the feed and explore page by the users‚Äô activity, history of interactions, and a poster‚Äôs activity. This can lead users down a rabbit hole of content, as the platform suggests more and more similar things.

Its algorithm is not without backlash‚Äîespecially when it comes to its effect on young users.

In 2021, Instagram was flagged for pushing dangerous content through its algorithms after an exposing experiment performed by Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal‚Äôs staff, per CNN.

The platform suggested material that promoted eating disorders to an account that was registered as being operated by a 13-year-old.

And in November, when self-harm images were posted on Instagram, despite Meta‚Äôs claim to remove 99% of all harmful content on the platform, all harrowing images were still visible after 30 days.

Ultimately, Meta deleted the triggering content from its server and addressed the error. However, this instance alone is enough for parents to lose their trust in the company.

In the aftermath of these controversies, Meta plans to increase the algorithm restrictions for registered teen accounts.

The company noted in a blog post that Instagram teen accounts will automatically be placed on the most restrictive setting of its sensitive content control. This would hide videos of people fighting or posts about cosmetic procedures, for example.

Parents aren‚Äôt buying it

Film buff and proud parent Antonio Escobar (@tony_scribe on X) is ready to shield his child from the entire platform as a whole, despite Instagram‚Äôs attempts to make it a safer place.

‚ÄúThe solution is no IG. I keep my pre-teen far, far away from it,‚Äù he told the Daily Dot.

Advertisement

Similarly, Adobe engineer and father Paul J Dayton (@pdayton on X) thinks as though the new accounts only mask the real problem. No matter how much restriction is placed against its own algorithm, Dayton argued, the addiction minors develop while using social media remains intact.

‚ÄúIt is like a tobacco company telling you they‚Äôve restricted the amount of times your teen can smoke a cigarette,‚Äù he quipped.

Even professional therapist Maddie Spear noted that social media usage among teens is a difficult beast to tame. Spear is the owner of Flourish Wellness PLLC and a popular social media content creator with over 325,000 followers on TikTok. Her age range of specialty is 5-25, those who would be most impacted by social media restrictions.

‚ÄúI immediately thought of the times when Facebook was really big, and we would all pretend to be 13 just so we could have a Facebook account,‚Äù she told The Daily Dot. ‚ÄúAnd so part of me is concerned over the regulations side of it. People are probably just going to claim that they are an adult anyways and make a real account.‚Äù

Meta plans to launch teen accounts on Instagram in January, before expanding the program to its other platforms. The company has yet to respond to the Daily Dot‚Äôs request for comment.

And while these regulations may be difficult to enforce, Spear said the movement offers a bit of hope in the darkness that can fester online.

‚ÄúNonetheless, in a world where social media has quickly become integrated in the livelihood for anyone it might feel dark and dim, and it might even be that way for a little bit, but there is going to be hope on the other side,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúThis is an app, it is not our life, even if it impacts a lot of it. We will figure this out together,‚Äù Spear concluded. ‚ÄúAs cheesy as it sounds, we‚Äôre going to get through this.‚Äù

Reddit Inc. RDDT has been riding a wave of optimism, with its stock surging over 125% in the past six months. While a modest 10% dip over the last month suggests some cooling, the bullish technical and fundamental indicators are hard to ignore.

Here's why investors are buzzing about the platform that Reddit users are hailing as an ""AI-learning goldmine.""

Reddit‚Äôs Stock Chart Suggests Buying Pressure

Chart created using Benzinga Pro

Reddit's stock, trading at $166.47, shows mixed short-term signals but undeniable long-term strength. The stock hovers slightly below its eight and 20-day SMAs (simple moving averages), a potential caution for short-term traders.

However, its MACD (moving average convergence/divergence) indicator at 7.62 flashes bullish, and a 50-day SMA of $141.28 underscores the stock's upward trajectory. Coupled with an RSI (relative strength index) of 56.04, Reddit appears to be consolidating for its next move higher.

Reddit‚Äôs Data-Fueled Partnership With Google

Fundamental bulls are taking a long-term view, bolstered by Reddit's collaboration with Alphabet Inc‚Äòs GOOGL GOOG Google. According to one Reddit user, Google's recent algorithm update has strategically elevated Reddit's visibility in search results, driving more traffic to its forums.

Even more compelling, Reddit's treasure trove of human-driven responses has attracted interest for training large language models (LLMs), with lucrative data-scraping deals adding to its revenue streams.

Revenue Streams, Global Expansion

Reddit reported a 16% increase in revenue per user and 50% user base growth, highlighting its ability to scale while monetizing effectively. Advertising revenue is climbing, with improved margins leading to positive EPS.

With plans to launch paid subreddit subscriptions and ""Reddit Answers,"" the company is building additional revenue streams while keeping its community engaged.

Looking ahead, Reddit's 2025 expansion into 35 countries promises to bring millions of new users into the fold. This growth potential, paired with its operational efficiency and sticky user base, has investors eyeing the company's future with optimism.

A Future Worth Betting On?

Reddit user Overlord1317, captures the sentiment of bullish investors succinctly: ""Reddit seems like the last of the ‚Äògigantic user base' social media sites to buy in the nascent stages.""

With its AI-friendly dataset, addictiveness, and synergy with Google, the platform is positioning itself as a formidable player in tech's next wave.

While Reddit faces short-term fluctuations, its long-term outlook remains strong.

For investors, this ""AI-learning goldmine"" could indeed be one of the most undervalued plays in social media.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a top oil and gas industry trade group have filed a lawsuit against Vermont over its new law requiring that fossil fuel companies pay for damage the state attributes to climate change.

The federal lawsuit, which was filed Monday, urges a state court to block the state from enforcing the law, which was passed by lawmakers last year, according to The Associated Press. The state said it is working to estimate the cost of climate change dating back to 1995.

Vermont became the first state in the country to enact a law of its kind after it suffered catastrophic summer flooding and damage from other extreme weather, the outlet noted.

The Chamber and the American Petroleum Institute argue in the lawsuit that the U.S. Constitution precludes the act and that the state law is preempted by the federal Clean Air Act, The Associated Press reported. The lawsuit also says that the law violates domestic and foreign commerce clauses by discriminating against the ""important interest of other states by targeting large energy companies located outside of Vermont.""

APPLE TO PAY $95 MILLION IN SIRI SPYING LAWSUIT

The plaintiffs say that the federal government is already addressing climate change, according to the report. The plaintiffs add that since greenhouse gases come from billions of individual sources, it is impossible to measure ""accurately and fairly"" the impact of emissions from a particular entity in a particular location over multiple decades.

""Vermont wants to impose massive retroactive penalties going back 30 years for lawful, out-of-state conduct that was regulated by Congress under the Clean Air Act,"" Tara Morrissey, senior vice president and deputy chief counsel of the Chamber‚Äôs litigation center, said, according to the report. ""That is unlawful and violates the structure of the U.S. Constitution ‚Äî one state can‚Äôt try to regulate a global issue best left to the federal government. Vermont‚Äôs penalties will ultimately raise costs for consumers in Vermont and across the country.""

The law requires the Vermont state treasurer, in consultation with the Agency of Natural Resources, to issue a report by Jan. 15, 2026, on the total cost to the state and its residents from the emission of greenhouse gases from Jan. 1, 1995, to Dec. 31, 2024. The review would examine the effects of greenhouse gasses on various areas, including public health, natural resources, agriculture, economic development and housing.

The state would use federal data to determine whether the amount of covered greenhouse gas emissions can be traced to a fossil fuel company.

The share of funds collected from the companies could be used by the state for things like improving stormwater drainage systems, upgrading roads and bridges, elevating or retrofitting sewage treatment plants and making energy-efficient weatherization upgrades to public and private buildings.

The law in Vermont captured interest from other states, including New York, where a similar bill was signed into law last month.

The New York law requires companies responsible for substantial greenhouse gas emissions to pay into a state fund for infrastructure projects to repair or prevent future damage from climate change, and the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases between 2000 and 2018 would face fines.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.9140150547027588,neutral,0.912329912185669,Neutral

2025-01-05T00:00:00Z,News,chicagotribune.com,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/01/05/tiktok-potential-ban/,"TikTok creators left in limbo while awaiting decision on potential platform ban

Will TikTok be banned this month?

That‚Äôs the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.

At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.

For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump‚Äôs recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.

If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.

‚ÄúA lot of my other creative friends, we‚Äôre all like freaking out. But I‚Äôm staying calm,‚Äù said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok‚Äôs live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films ‚ÄúGambit‚Äù and ‚ÄúAwaken! My Neighbor.‚Äù

Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is ‚Äúhard to accept.‚Äù

Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they‚Äôve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.

For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.

‚ÄúI believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,‚Äù said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.

It‚Äôs unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.

Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief ‚Äî written by his pick for solicitor general ‚Äî Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban ‚Äúsweeping and troubling‚Äù and said he wants a ‚Äúnegotiated resolution‚Äù to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.

While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.

Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn‚Äôt found a place quite like TikTok, she‚Äôs begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.

According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.

Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform ‚Äî and its algorithm ‚Äî with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.

Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,‚Äù said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.

A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he‚Äôd struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.

‚ÄúFor me, this has been my sole way of doing business,‚Äù Hurst said.

Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency‚Äôs founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.

But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million month U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.

If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn‚Äôt have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions ‚Äî which will prevent them from updating the app ‚Äî will eventually make the app ‚Äúunworkable,‚Äù the Justice Department has said.

TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge.

New Orleans attacker recorded visits to the city weeks earlier

The U.S. Army veteran who deliberately plowed into New Year's revelers in New Orleans visited the city twice in the weeks before the attack and recorded video using Meta smart glasses, the FBI revealed Sunday.

Shamsud-Din Jabbar also had the Meta glasses during his New Year's Day attack, but they were not activated for a livestream, and there was no indication he was recording the attack at all.

He did record videos during the drive addressed to his family, in which he talked about plans to kill them and told them he had joined the Islamic State.

On Saturday hundreds of New Orleanians gathered at City of Love Church to seek solace and understanding ‚Äî singing, shouting and praying.

""Even though we're going through it, things will get better,"" Bishop Lester Love told the congregation. ""The city is hurting, but it is also resilient.""

Experts warn that polarization in the United States and online is contributing to an increase in extremism. ‚ÄúThe online environment has algorithms that are set up to make you angry. And all that is playing into a perfect storm of factors that are leading to an increase in radicalization,‚Äù said Seamus Hughes, a senior researcher and policy associate at the University of Nebraska Omaha.

Major winter storm threatens the U.S.

Tens of millions of people are under winter storm warnings, with heavy snow and bitter cold temperatures expected across the country.

Kansas, Arkansas, Kentucky and Virginia declared states of emergency, and the National Weather Service warned of ""considerable disruptions to daily life,"" including ""dangerous or impossible driving conditions and widespread closures.""

Temperatures are expected to drop 10 to 30 degrees below average through Friday across the Central and Eastern U.S. From Montana to Wisconsin, wind chills will plummet to between minus 25 and minus 35 degrees.

Washington, D.C., was one of the major cities preparing for snowy and icy conditions into Monday, when Congress is meant to certify the presidential election results. ""Whether we're in a blizzard or not, we're going to be in that chamber making sure this is done,"" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.

Indie filmmaker Jeff Baena dead at 47

Jeff Baena, an independent writer-director known for movies like ‚ÄúLife After Beth‚Äù and ‚ÄúI Heart Huckabees,‚Äù died Friday at 47.

He died by suicide at a home, according to the Los Angeles County medical examiner's records.

Baena had been married to actor Aubrey Plaza since 2021. The couple collaborated on several films, including ‚ÄúLife After Beth‚Äù in 2014, which Baena directed and Plaza starred in.

Meet the Press

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sunday that the attack in New Orleans shows Kash Patel shouldn't be confirmed as President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the FBI.

Schiff said on ""Meet the Press"" that the attack ""underscores"" the importance of an FBI director ""that has experience, has judgment, that has character, that will prioritize defending the country against the violence we saw in New Orleans or the violence we saw on Jan. 6.""

He said that Patel's top priority is ""political vendettas"" and that the Senate shouldn't confirm someone ""who believes in 'deep state' conspiracy thinking.""

Politics in brief

The highest civilian award: President Joe Biden gave the Presidential Medal of Freedom to notable figures including Hillary Clinton, billionaire George Soros, actor Michael J. Fox, fashion icon Anna Wintour and Bill Nye the Science Guy.

Carter's long goodbye: Jimmy Carter‚Äôs extended public farewell began Saturday in Georgia, with a procession and a private family service at the Carter Center ahead of Thursday's state funeral in Washington, D.C.

Trump's priorities: Speaker Johnson told House Republicans that Trump favors passing a single reconciliation bill, rather than two or more, which could be a blow to some GOP hard-liners.

47 & 16: Trump has a particular fixation on Abraham Lincoln, treating him as not only a giant of history but also something of a political contemporary (and a flawed one at that).

TikTok ban: The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to reject Trump's request to delay implementing a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the United States or force its sale by its Chinese parent company by Jan. 19.

Hollywood gathers for the 82nd Golden Globes

Hollywood awards season officially kicked off Sunday night with the 82nd Golden Globe Awards, hosted by comedian Nikki Glaser who got rave reviews inside the auditorium.

FX‚Äôs ‚ÄúSh≈çgun,‚Äù a sweeping saga set in feudal Japan, took home four awards, including best drama series, making it the biggest small-screen winner of the night. Netflix‚Äôs ‚ÄúEmilia P√©rez,‚Äù a genre-busting song-and-dance spectacle about a Mexican drug cartel boss who undergoes gender-affirming surgery, also took home four awards.

Demi Moore delivered a powerful acceptance speech after she won her first major industry award for her role in ‚ÄúThe Substance.‚Äù ‚ÄúThirty years ago I had a producer tell me that I was a popcorn actress, and at that time, I made that mean that this wasn‚Äôt something I allowed to have,‚Äù she said.

A24‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Brutalist,‚Äù a sweeping epic about the postwar immigrant experience, took home three awards, including best drama film and best actor to Adrien Brody. Here is the full list of winners.

By JONATHAN LANDRUM JR. and HALELUYA HADERO

Will TikTok be banned this month?

That‚Äôs the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.

At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.

For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump‚Äôs recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.

If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.

‚ÄúA lot of my other creative friends, we‚Äôre all like freaking out. But I‚Äôm staying calm,‚Äù said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok‚Äôs live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films ‚ÄúGambit‚Äù and ‚ÄúAwaken! My Neighbor.‚Äù

Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is ‚Äúhard to accept.‚Äù

Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they‚Äôve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.

For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.

‚ÄúI believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,‚Äù said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.

It‚Äôs unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.

Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief ‚Äî written by his pick for solicitor general ‚Äî Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban ‚Äúsweeping and troubling‚Äù and said he wants a ‚Äúnegotiated resolution‚Äù to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.

Woman can testify Weinstein used force to rape her despite his acquittal, judge rules While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.

Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn‚Äôt found a place quite like TikTok, she‚Äôs begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.

According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.

Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform ‚Äî and its algorithm ‚Äî with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.

Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,‚Äù said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.

A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he‚Äôd struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.

‚ÄúFor me, this has been my sole way of doing business,‚Äù Hurst said.

Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency‚Äôs founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.

But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.

If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn‚Äôt have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions ‚Äî which will prevent them from updating the app ‚Äî will eventually make the app ‚Äúunworkable,‚Äù the Justice Department has said.

TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge.

While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.

Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn‚Äôt found a place quite like TikTok, she‚Äôs begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.

According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.

Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform ‚Äî and its algorithm ‚Äî with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.

Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,‚Äù said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.

A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he‚Äôd struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.

‚ÄúFor me, this has been my sole way of doing business,‚Äù Hurst said.

Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency‚Äôs founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.

But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.

If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn‚Äôt have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions ‚Äî which will prevent them from updating the app ‚Äî will eventually make the app ‚Äúunworkable,‚Äù the Justice Department has said.

TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.15774667263031,curiosity,0.5569473505020142,Anti-ban

On December 31, President-elect Donald Trump filed an amicus brief in an attempt to stall the demise of TikTok. This Chinese spyware app masquerading as a social media platform is owned by ByteDance, which is headquartered in Beijing. By law, TikTok must be sold, or it will be subject to an outright ban in the U.S. by January 19, one day before Trump takes office. The Supreme Court is currently evaluating the constitutionality of quashing TikTok, though Trump is arguing that the ban should be stalled so that he can negotiate a (different) resolution.

The TikTok ban has bipartisan support. It passed the House 360-58 and the Senate 79-18. It‚Äôs also worth noting that Trump originally endorsed the ban in his first term.

Why the sudden switch? TikTok is obviously Chinese spyware. The Chinese Communists collect data on TikTok users in the U.S. ‚Äî even young children. TikTok also suppresses certain speech and has a toxic influence on American culture.

There are a few possibilities that might play into Trump‚Äôs switcheroo. Perhaps it‚Äôs a political move to compel Gen Z voters ‚Äî the primary users of the app ‚Äî to view him in a more positive light. If Daily Wire host Reagan Conrad‚Äôs sentiments are an accurate reflection of that generation, then it‚Äôs a brilliant political move.

Another possibility is that Trump successfully used TikTok as a campaign tool and would hate to lose that particular avenue to attract youthful voters.

Trump also feels that he should have the right to weigh in on the issue because, according to the Wall Street Journal editorial board, ‚ÄúHe won the election and is a wizard on social media. Really, that‚Äôs his claim.‚Äù The editors continue, ‚ÄúHis brief says he has special standing to represent the interests of some 170 million American TikTok users because he founded the ‚Äòresoundingly successful social-media platform, Truth Social‚Äô and is ‚Äòone of the most powerful, prolific, and influential users of social media in history.‚Äô‚Äù

Trump is wrong on this one. The National Review editors lay out exactly why: ‚ÄúWe have one president at a time, even when that president is a barely-functional lame duck. Trump has no legal standing to ask that decisions be held over until he assumes the power to make them.‚Äù

This is a very important point. Allowing Trump to not only weigh in on an issue but undo a congressional law before his allotted term sets a bad precedent for future incoming presidents. While the temptation is great, especially considering that Joe Biden is mentally no longer with us, it‚Äôs still not right.

‚ÄúWhile prudence sometimes counsels against a departing president preempting his successor,‚Äù National Review‚Äôs editors add, ‚Äúthe TikTok ban is the result of carefully-considered bipartisan legislation many months in the making. Having been signed into law, it does not need to wait to be reconsidered by a new president. Indeed, the timeline requiring a resolution by January 19 was included in the statute, reflecting a congressional desire to resolve the matter before the new presidential term begins.‚Äù

The Supreme Court will hear the TikTok case this Friday. One can only hope that SCOTUS will affirm Congress in this matter and prevent Trump from making a foreign policy mistake. TikTok‚Äôs toxic influence has gone on quite long enough.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.3093692064285278,neutral,0.9382094144821168,Pro-ban

2025-01-09T00:00:00Z,News,cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-trial-ban-appeal-bytedance/,"TikTok could shut down unless Supreme Court blocks or delays U.S. ban

What grounds does Trump have to request a TikTok ban delay from the Supreme Court?

In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.

TikTok could shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.

""Absent such relief, the Act will take effect on January 19, 2025,"" TikTok said in a Dec. 9 legal filing. ""That would shut down TikTok‚Äîone of the Nation's most popular speech platforms ‚Äî for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.""

Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a ""political resolution"" and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views ‚Äî a highly unusual attempt to influence a case ‚Äî into account.

TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.

""Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,"" lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.

The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.

How TikTok could avoid a ban



TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.

Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that ""evidence of significant progress"" toward a divestiture has taken place.

TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.

The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that ""no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.""

Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.

But the government ""concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,"" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.

In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.

Trump urges court to pause

Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.

In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.

""President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government ‚Äî concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,"" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.

Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.

The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.

If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.

But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.

As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.

TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.

But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.

A decision could come within days.

NEW On the move? Let us read it for you. LISTEN NOW Your browser does not support the audio element.

Amid a looming U.S. ban on TikTok, its content creators have been pushing the platform's sister app, Lemon8. The platform resembles an amalgamation of the types of short-form videos found on TikTok and the picture-perfect aesthetic of Instagram and Pinterest.

Like its popular relation, Lemon8 is owned by China-based ByteDance, whose collection of internationally available apps also includes the video editing app CapCut and the photo and art editing app Hypic. In addition, the company operates Douyin, the Chinese sibling of TikTok that follows China's strict censorship rules.

Lemon8 was released in the U.S. in 2023, a few years after it first popped up in Asian markets. Though it garnered some media and user interest in its early days, the app hasn't taken off as much as TikTok, which has more than 170 million U.S. users.

But more people have downloaded the app in the past month, making it one of the top-ranking free apps on Apple's app store. Lemon8's popularity could increase depending on the outcome of a U.S. Supreme Court hearing Friday over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with ByteDance or face a U.S. ban.

TikTok says it plans to shut down the platform in the United States by Jan. 19 if the government prevails, as it did in a lower court.

Influencers previously worked with Lemon8 to promote the lesser-known app on TikTok. In recent weeks, many of them have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law. Some have also been recommending it through paid sponsored posts tagged #lemon8partner, showing a recent corporate push to generate more users.

But there's a hitch. The law, which would wipe out TikTok's U.S. operation if it's not sold to an approved buyer, states the divest-or-ban requirement applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by ByteDance, TikTok or any of their subsidiaries. That means even though Lemon8 and CapCut are not explicitly named in the statute, their futures in the U.S. also are in jeopardy.

The recent Lemon8 ads on TikTok also may be a sign that ByteDance is ""hoping or betting"" Lemon8 slips through the cracks as lawmakers and regulators focus their attention on TikTok, Enberg said. Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2025-01-10T00:00:00Z,News,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/10/how-does-tiktok-ban-work,"How does the US Tiktok ban work?

TikTok is no longer available in the US. In both mobile app stores and on users‚Äô phones, the app has gone dark.

When opening the app, users who had already downloaded TikTok before 19 January were met with a pop-up message that prompted them to learn more about the ban or close the app.

‚ÄúA law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US. Unfortunately, that means you can‚Äôt use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned,‚Äù the message read.

More than 170 million Americans used TikTok. Lawyers for the company contend that banning the app violates the first amendment rights of those tens of millions of users; the argument did not sway a federal appeals court, which upheld the ban-or-sale bill in December. Congress passed the legislation with a bipartisan majority in April. US legislators fear that China will collect sensitive data on American users and spread propaganda through the app, though they have produced no documentation of such manipulation. That said, the supreme court wrote in its opinion that even if China had not yet attempted to exert its influence over the platform, that there was ‚Äúsubstantial evidence‚Äù to suggest it could one day do so.

TikTok‚Äôs future is still uncertain. Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated Monday, says he wants to give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban.

Here‚Äôs how the ban is playing out:

What becomes of the app? Existing users can open TikTok, and the app icon still appears on their phones, but they are not able to scroll through videos. New users will not be able to download TikTok from app stores and existing users will not be able to update it, because the law prohibits any entity from facilitating the download or maintenance of the TikTok application. In a 13 December letter, US lawmakers told Apple and Alphabet‚Äôs Google, which operate the two main mobile app stores, that they must be ready to remove TikTok from their stores on 19 January. The cloud service provider Oracle could see some disruption to its work with TikTok. Oracle hosts TikTok‚Äôs US user data on its servers, reviews the app‚Äôs source code and delivers the app to the app stores ‚Äì all services it will be forbidden from providing when the ban goes into effect. Google declined to comment, while Oracle and Apple did not respond to requests for comment.

How will users be affected? Experts believed TikTok‚Äôs 170 million users in the US would probably still be able to use the app because it was already downloaded on their phones. Then, over time, without software and security updates, the app would become unusable. That is not what happened. ByteDance shut off access to TikTok the day before the ban went into effect. Some users have begun posting TikTok videos instructing others on how to use virtual private networks (VPNs), which mask an internet user‚Äôs location, as a way to circumvent the possible ban. Content creators who have built businesses from their TikTok followings are preparing for the worst. Nadya Okamoto, who has 4.1m followers and founded August, a menstrual products brand, said TikTok helped her business grow organically through viral videos. A TikTok ban could force her and other small businesses to spend more on marketing and raise their costs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very stressful,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf TikTok goes away, we‚Äôll be OK, but it is going to be a hard hit.‚Äù

What happens to TikTok‚Äôs employees? TikTok‚Äôs 7,000 employees in the US are still trying to figure out their fate. After a US appeals court upheld the sell-or-ban law on 6 December, pessimism spread among staffers who began worrying about layoffs, said one current employee. But the company has continued to make job offers for new roles, prompting some confused job seekers to ask for advice on Blind, an anonymous forum for employees to discuss companies. One user posted on Blind that they received a job offer from ByteDance in San Jose, California, starting in February. Others commented on the post, counseling the user to accept the offer and use it as leverage in other interviews. ‚ÄúI signed the offer and will wait and watch how the situation unfolds,‚Äù the user said in the Blind post.

What will advertisers do? TikTok‚Äôs US ad revenue is expected to total $12.3bn in 2024, according to the research firm Emarketer, and while that is much smaller than Instagram‚Äôs owner, Meta Platforms, advertisers say TikTok‚Äôs devoted user base means some brands will try to advertise beyond 19 January. ‚ÄúThe ongoing assumption is the app might not be updatable, but you‚Äôll see a groundswell of usage,‚Äù said Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3. The app‚Äôs e-commerce feature TikTok Shop, which lets users purchase products directly from videos, has no direct competitor that advertisers can easily switch to, Atkinson said, adding that his agency was signing new contracts with clients to build TikTok Shop campaigns even as of late December. Some advertisers may continue spending beyond 19 January on TikTok and re-evaluate if the app sees declining usage or performance, said Jason Lee, executive vice-president of brand safety at the media agency Horizon Media.

Are there potential buyers? TikTok has repeatedly said it cannot be sold by ByteDance. That hasn‚Äôt deterred the billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team who said he has secured $20bn in verbal commitments from a consortium of investors to bid for TikTok. McCourt has not yet spoken with ByteDance, but said he believes the supreme court will uphold the law requiring TikTok‚Äôs divestment, after which the parent company would be more open to sale discussions. McCourt and his team have had ‚Äúpreliminary conversations‚Äù with members of the incoming administration of Donald Trump, who had tried to ban TikTok during his first term in the White House but has since reversed his views, and are also seeking a CEO to lead the app. McCourt‚Äôs business plan for TikTok includes migrating the app on to open-source technology and earning revenue through e-commerce and licensing data for AI training.

Has this happened before? The state of Montana banned TikTok in May 2023, planning to make the app inaccessible to state residents come 1 January 2024 before a US judge blocked the ban. Like the federal ban, Montana‚Äôs targeted the app store, but unlike the nationwide prohibition, the state threatened Apple and Google with $10,000-a-day fines as long as they made TikTok available.

What will China do? Under Chinese law, officials in Beijing would probably need to approve of such a large sale for it to go through. In March, China signaled opposition to a forced sale, which, along with TikTok‚Äôs declaration of the impossibility of divestment, renders the outcome unlikely.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.2630265355110168,neutral,0.4074438810348511,Anti-ban

The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments Friday on the TikTok ban set to kick in later this month ‚Äî unless the conservative-majority court decides to block the law within the next week.

If the Supreme Court decides not to intervene, TikTok will be unavailable to download everywhere in the U.S., including in Wisconsin, starting Jan. 19.

Last April, Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed a bill banning TikTok nationwide, unless ByteDance, its Chinese parent company, sold the platform to another company. ByteDance has been embroiled in legal battles for months to attempt to block the ban, and the Supreme Court ruling comes as a last-ditch effort.

Here's what to know about the TikTok ban, as a final ruling is set to drop:

Will TikTok be banned in Wisconsin?

If ByteDance doesn't sell the app or if the Supreme Court doesn't intervene, it will no longer be possible to download TikTok from Apple's App Store or Google Play, or to access the app on a U.S. internet browser.

People in the U.S. who already have the TikTok app can still use it, but they would not have access to future software updates if TikTok is no longer in app stores. Without updates, it's likely the app would deteriorate over time and become unusable.

Why is TikTok considered a national security threat?

Proponents of the TikTok ban are primarily concerned with ByteDance, a Chinese-owned company based in Beijing, having access to U.S. users' data. More than 170 million Americans use TikTok.

In particular, both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have said the Chinese government could potentially spy on Americans or spread propaganda through the app. The ban received overwhelming bipartisan support, with the Senate passing it 79-18 and the House, 352-65.

In 2022, Congress and Biden also approved a bill banning TikTok on U.S. government devices over similar national security concerns.

Which Wisconsin politicians support banning TikTok?

Wisconsin's congressional delegation has been largely supportive of the TikTok ban.

In fact, former Wisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher was an author of the bill and has been a longtime advocate of banning the app.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt take the chance of having a dominant news platform in America controlled or owned by a company that is beholden to the Chinese Communist Party, our foremost adversary,‚Äù Gallagher, a Green Bay Republican, said last year.

Gallagher left Congress in April and later took a job leading the defense business for data analytics and security firm Palantir.

Of Wisconsin's eight-member House delegation, the only representatives to vote against the TikTok ban were Democratic Reps. Mark Pocan and Gwen Moore.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs probably valid concerns when it comes to social media disinformation and all the rest,‚Äù Pocan told the Journal Sentinel in March. ‚ÄúBut to say that a single platform is the problem largely because it‚Äôs Chinese-owned honestly, I think, borders more on xenophobia than addressing that core issue.‚Äù

On the Senate side, the ban passed as part of a sweeping, $95 billion foreign aid package that provided funds to Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies. Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin voted in favor of the package, while Republican Sen. Ron Johnson voted against.

How has TikTok responded to the ban?

TikTok and ByteDance have routinely denied claims that the app poses a national security threat to the U.S., according to USA TODAY.

In Friday morning's oral arguments, Noel Franciso, a lawyer for TikTok, said the ban would violate the free speech rights of the company and its users, USA TODAY reported.

In its petitions to the court, ByteDance has also claimed selling the platform is ""not possible,"" commercially, technologically or legally.

What has incoming President Donald Trump said about the ban?

President-elect Donald Trump said last month that he can find a way to ""save"" TikTok and asked the Supreme Court to pause the law. Trump will take office on Jan. 20, a day after the ban is set to kick in.

In his first term, Trump had said he wanted the app shut down.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.2198719382286071,neutral,0.9129395484924316,Neutral

WASHINGTON ‚àí As the Supreme Court on Friday heard starkly different views on whether the government can effectively ban a social media platform used by 170 million Americans, Chief Justice John Roberts asked if the Chinese-based ByteDance is using TikTok to get Americans to argue with each other.

‚ÄúIf they do, I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre winning,‚Äù Roberts said to laughter in the court.

But there didn‚Äôt seem to be a lot of argument among the justices themselves about where they stood.

Before Friday‚Äôs approximately two-and-a-half hours of debate, experts thought the court was more likely to be swayed by the government‚Äôs national security concerns than by TikTok‚Äôs claim that forcing the company to break ties with ByteDance or be banned in the U.S. violates the 1st Amendment rights of TikTok and its users.

The justices did, in fact, spend more time pushing against TikTok‚Äôs arguments than it did sparring with Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who was defending the sell-or-be-banned law passed by Congress last year and backed by President Joe Biden.

But looming over the debate was what could happen after President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20, the day after TikTok must be divested.

Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first administration, has since promised to ‚Äúsave‚Äù it.

Here are the top takeaways from Friday‚Äôs arguments.

How real is TikTok threat?

TikTok represents a national-security threat in part because of the massive amounts of data the company shares with its parent company in China, ByteDance, according to Prelogar.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs eye-opening,‚Äù Prelogar said. ‚ÄúIt creates this gaping vulnerability in the system because once that data is in China, the PRC (People‚Äôs Republic of China) can demand that ByteDance turn that data over and keep that assistance secret.‚Äù

Roberts said Congress found ByteDance to be ‚Äúsubject to Chinese laws that require it to assist or cooperate with the Chinese government‚Äôs intelligence work.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre we supposed to ignore that the ultimate parent is in fact subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?‚Äù Roberts asked TikTok‚Äôs lawyer. ‚ÄúIt seems to me that you are ignoring the major concern here of Congress, which was Chinese manipulation of the content, and acquisition and harvesting of the content.‚Äù

Justice Brett Kavanaugh said Congress and the president were concerned China is harvesting information about Americans over time to develop spies and blackmail people years from now.

‚ÄúThat seems like a huge concern for the future of the country,‚Äù Kavanaugh said.

ByteDance's ‚àí and China's ‚àí control of TikTok disputed

Justice Neil Gorsuch said the government and TikTok dispute how much control China has over the company and asked what the record shows.

""Somebody has to be right and somebody has to be wrong about that,"" he said.

Noel Francisco, a TikTok lawyer, said that while it would be a bad business decision for the company to choose not to use ByteDance‚Äôs algorithm as a matter of course, it can still refuse China's pressure to do something nefarious.

‚ÄúEven if China could exercise overwhelming power against TikTok versus ByteDance, I don‚Äôt think it would change the legal analysis,‚Äù Francisco said.

Could Trump choose not to enforce the law?

Kavanaugh probed whether Trump can choose not to enforce the ban after he takes office on Jan. 20.

The Justice Department‚Äôs lawyer, Prelogar, said presidents generally have discretion about how to enforce laws. Trump would want to review all the national security information that has been gathered since he was last in office before deciding whether to enforce the ban, she said.

Kavanaugh suggested Apple, Google and any other conduits for the app may feel a presidential directive not to enforce the law wouldn't be enough protection from the law‚Äôs stiff penalties.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not going to take that risk unless they have the assurance that a presidential statement of non-enforcement is in fact something that can be fully relied on because the risk is too severe otherwise, right?‚Äù Kavanaugh asked.

Prelogar said decisions by third-party companies to not carry TikTok wouldn‚Äôt be permanent, but could spur ByteDance to seriously consider selling TikTok.

Alito questions whether court could temporarily block law

Justice Samuel Alito asked whether the court could temporarily postpone the law from taking effect Jan. 19.

Prelogar said the court shouldn‚Äôt do that unless TikTok was likely to win based on its First Amendment claim of a right to distribute its content. But she said that was unlikely because it wasn‚Äôt just an executive action, but done in concert with bipartisan majorities in Congress.

‚ÄúTo be honest, I think that there is no argument to be made that you should find that likelihood of success,‚Äù Prelogar said.

Alito also asked whether the court could administratively halt the law temporarily. Prelogar said she would defer to the justices about whether they have enough time to decide the case, but that both sides were ready to argue the case Friday.

‚ÄúI think it is in the interest of Congress‚Äô work and our national security to resolve the case and allow the statute to take effect,‚Äù she said.

Justice Department said TikTok may be playing chicken

TikTok‚Äôs attorney said the company won‚Äôt be able to meet the law‚Äôs divestiture requirement by Jan. 19, so the platform will cease to exist in the U.S. unless the law is blocked.

‚ÄúAt least as I understand it, we go dark,‚Äù Francisco said. ‚ÄúEssentially the platform shuts down.‚Äù

The Justice Department said the company may be engaging in a game of chicken with the government.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hoping the United States is going to blink first through our court system or through the executive branch getting cold feet about enforcing the law,‚Äù Prelogar said.

But when push comes to shove and the restrictions take effect on Jan. 19, she said, TikTok might find it can divest after all.

Are 1st Amendment rights at stake?

The two sides clashed over whether the ban infringes on the First Amendment rights of TikTok, an American company, or of its users.

Francisco, a former solicitor general representing TikTok, said it‚Äôs the algorithm that decides what is the best mix of content. Losing the ByteDance algorithm through a sale of TikTok would limit the app's ability to serve its users.

And Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer representing TikTok creators, said Americans have long enjoyed the right to work with foreign publishers.

The government‚Äôs concern that China can covertly manipulate content on the platform is not enough to overcome the First Amendment issues, he said.

‚ÄúMere ideas do not constitute a national security threat,‚Äù Fisher said, and restricting speech because it might sow doubt about U.S. leaders or undermine democracy ‚Äúare the kinds of things our enemies do.‚Äù

But Prelogar said the First Amendment would only come into play if Congress has been trying to discriminate against particular subject matters or viewpoints.

‚ÄúHere, Congress just wants to cut the (People's Republic of China) out of the equation altogether and all the same speech could continue to happen on the platform,‚Äù Prelogar said.

Are there better ways of addressing the government's concerns?

Attorneys for TikTok and the platform's content creators argued the government had less drastic ways of addressing its concerns about covert content manipulation or data gathering.

The government could require a warning to users of the potential for Chinese government manipulation and could prohibit TikTok from sharing sensitive user data with a foreign adversary, they argued.

But Prelogar said a ‚Äúgeneric, generalized disclosure‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt reasonably put users on notice about when the manipulation is happening. She compared that to a sign in a store telling customers that one of the million items in that store causes cancer.

Prelogar also said she was surprised to hear TikTok‚Äôs attorney say it‚Äôs possible to block TikTok from sharing data with ByteDance. During the years-long discussions between the government and the company, she said, TikTok never suggested it was possible to create a ‚Äútrue firewall.‚Äù

ByteDance, Prelogar added, is ‚Äúnot a trusted partner.‚Äù

Alito: Does TikTok have 'magical algorithm'?

Alito questioned what‚Äôs so special about TikTok. He mused about other social-media companies such as Meta jumping in to ‚Äútake advantage of the very lucrative market.‚Äù And he suggested allegiance of its content creators might just be like the preference for a familiar old shirt.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just wondering whether this is like somebody‚Äôs attachment to an old article of clothing,‚Äù Alito said. ‚ÄúIs there some reason to think only ByteDance has devised this magical algorithm?‚Äù

But Fisher, a lawyer for TikTok creators, said competitors have tried for years to match TikTok‚Äôs success and ‚Äúfallen dramatically‚Äù short.

TikTok users ponder a post-TikTok world

As the justices debated the fate of TikTok, Americans who use the platform for news, entertainment or to make a living were pondering a post-TikTok world.

Callie Goodwin, who flew in from South Carolina with a friend and fellow TikTok content creator for the oral arguments, said as much as 98% of the sales from her greeting card and personalized gift store come from people who find her business on TikTok.

Several months ago, during the height of the holiday gift shopping season, she said she sold over $30,000 worth of products on the app in just nine days.

‚ÄúIf we were to lose TikTok, I really fear for the survival of my business,‚Äù Goodwin told USA TODAY.

But Eli Benson, a college student, said he might take a TikTok ban as a cue to decrease her social media consumption.

‚ÄúMaybe this is my sign to be done,‚Äù Benson said. ‚ÄúI would be ready for a little bit less social media.‚Äù",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.2997605204582214,neutral,0.6581123471260071,Pro-ban
2025-01-11T00:00:00Z,News,usatoday.com,https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2025/01/11/tiktok-ban-sell-project-liberty/77602746007/,"Project Liberty makes offer to TikTok. Here's what to know about the potential buyer.

As the deadline for a potential TikTok ban in the U.S. approaches, billionaire and former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt's Project Liberty confirmed making a formal offer to Bytedance, the platform's Chinese parent company, to buy the social media giant's American assets.

The offer, announced Thursday by Project Liberty, comes ahead of a Jan. 19 deadline for ByteDance to sell the platform or face a ban on national security grounds.

Project Liberty's President Tomicah Tillemann said in a statement that the organization would not publicly disclose the bid amount. However, the group previously said it had secured $20 billion in verbal commitments from a group of investors ready to bid for TikTok.

Is TikTok getting banned? Why the Supreme Court is likely to side against 170 million users

Last year, President Joe Biden signed a law banning the foreign-owned app unless it sells its U.S. assets. The legislation received overwhelming bipartisan support from lawmakers, who expressed concerns over the Chinese government's potential to spy on more than the 170 million Americans who use TikTok and to conduct covert influence operations.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

The social media giant has repeatedly stated it does not pose a security threat and the proposed ban violates free speech protections under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.

On Friday, the Supreme Court heard arguments from the U.S. government and TikTok about the impending ban, which President-elect Donald Trump has recently said he does not support.

In late December, Trump urged the court to put a hold on the Jan. 19 deadline to give his incoming administration ""the opportunity to pursue a political resolution of the questions at issue in the case.""

TikTok did not immediately respond for comment about the bid when contacted by USA TODAY.

What would Project Liberty be buying?

If Project Liberty acquired TikTok, it would only be the U.S. portion of the platform and would not include TikTok's algorithm, which China sees as its intellectual property, McCourt told CBS last month.

The non-profit plans to migrate TikTok's user base to an American-built digital infrastructure designed to put people back in charge of their data, according to a statement released on Thursday.

Who is this potential buyer, Project Liberty?

In 2021, McCourt invested $100 million to establish Project Liberty, an initiative aimed at decentralizing the internet, Anna Feagan, McCourt Global's communications director, told USA TODAY. In 2023, he increased his investment to $500 million.

""The internet is broken and it's urgent that we fix it,"" in a statement released by McCourt on the Project Liberty website. ""The institutions and ideals we cherish most are being destroyed for the use of free apps that steal our personal data and digital identities.""

While TikTok has denied they would consider selling the app, McCourt thinks the parent company would be more open to discussions if and when the Supreme Court shuts down their U.S. operation, according to Reuters.

To date, McCourt and his team have had ""preliminary conversations"" with members of the incoming administration with the hopes of finding a resolution before the app is shut down.

""By keeping the platform alive without relying on the current TikTok algorithm and avoiding a ban, millions of Americans can continue to enjoy the platform. We look forward to working with ByteDance, President-elect Trump, and the incoming administration to get this deal done,"" McCourt said.

USA TODAY's Jessica Guynn, Rachel Looker, Rebecca Morin, Ken Tran, Anthony Robledo and Reuters contributed to the reporting of this story.

The US Supreme Court is set to rule on TikTok‚Äôs fate this week. The social media platform is in court challenging a law that would force its Chinese parent company ByteDance into a sale or face a US TikTok ban. After hearing oral arguments for and against the ban, the Supreme Court appears poised to uphold it. It would go into effect on Sunday.

is a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.

RedNote, the Chinese social media app also known as Xiaohongshu, rose to the number one spot on the Apple App Store as a US ban closes in on TikTok. The app offers a mix of pictures, short-form videos, and text posts across ‚Äúfollow,‚Äù ‚Äúexplore,‚Äù and ‚Äúnearby‚Äù feeds.

A cursory scroll through RedNote‚Äôs Explore page shows English-language posts scattered among those written in Chinese. Many American users call themselves ‚ÄúTikTok refugees‚Äù in videos, while others write in text posts that they‚Äôre in search of a new community because of the potential TikTok ban. Some are even asking questions to Chinese users, such as ‚ÄúWhat are some popular memes in China?‚Äù

RedNote, which launched in 2013 as a shopping-focused app, now has more than 300 million monthly active users and surpassed $1 billion in profit last year, according to Bloomberg.

Last week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments over whether to uphold the law that will ban TikTok or force its China-based owner, ByteDance, to sell it to an American company. The Supreme Court has until January 19th to issue a decision.

TikTok users may be flocking to RedNote now, but the ban also implicates other Chinese-owned apps, including RedNote, WeChat, and the other apps run by ByteDance like Lemon8 and CapCut.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.4608497619628906,neutral,0.8694127202033997,Neutral

TikTok users are pushing back against the looming TikTok ban set to potentially go into effect Sunday by downloading a Chinese app called RedNote, which some users are calling ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs TikTok.‚Äù

TikTok‚Äôs ban was largely derived from national security concerns related to TikTok‚Äôs Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and many users are moving to RedNote as an explicit form of protest.

Known as Xiaohongshu in China, RedNote is a social media platform that includes images, short-form videos, community building tools, shopping and more. It is not a one-to-one TikTok clone, and it is not owned by ByteDance. It is owned by Shanghai-based Xingyin Information Technology.

American TikTokers who fear losing the platform have suggested their followers join them in downloading RedNote to send a message to the U.S. government, as well as the social media company Meta, which stands to gain new users of its TikTok-like product, Reels, if the ban goes into effect. Meta reportedly used a Republican lobbying firm to spread ill will toward TikTok in 2022.

Some have said that following a ban, they are prepared to do weeklong Meta blackouts, meaning they will not use any Meta apps, such as Instagram and Facebook.

On Monday, RedNote was the top free-to-download app on the Apple App Store, followed by TikTok‚Äôs sister app Lemon8.

Users say that while they wait to see whether the U.S. Supreme Court will give TikTok an eleventh-hour reprieve, they plan to use RedNote if TikTok goes away Sunday. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about RedNote.

What is RedNote, and what are people saying about it?

RedNote is a Shanghai-based Chinese-language social media app that offers a little bit of everything Americans are used to in a social media app. Users can share videos, post pictures, make text posts and access a host of shopping features.

The interface is different from TikTok‚Äôs in that a video does not immediately start playing upon the app‚Äôs opening and users must log in to begin using it. However, it is similar in that it serves content it thinks each user will like.

Although RedNote has been available in English, some users reported Monday that it appeared to be more accessible for its American user base as its popularity grew.

Some posts Monday on RedNote welcomed ‚ÄúTikTok refugees‚Äù to the platform.

Other users joked about meeting their TikTok-designated ‚ÄúChinese spy‚Äù on RedNote, with some Chinese users chiming in that they were happy to find their American counterparts.

How are memes driving people to the platform?

On TikTok, some videos of people joking about saying goodbye to their ‚ÄúChinese spy‚Äù (some in Mandarin) have racked up millions of views and likes. The memes are part of a deeper resentment some users feel toward the U.S. government for moving to ban TikTok in the name of security and safety even though some lawmakers use it themselves, as well as toward the continued politicization of other social media companies, like X and Meta.

The anger was on full display on TikTok as some explained why they were downloading RedNote.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to download it on my phone. I‚Äôm going to let it track other apps. I‚Äôm going to give it permission to see my location and all of my contacts and then I‚Äôm just going to let it sit there,‚Äù a TikTok user posted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to let it sit there as a little window through which my personal Chinese spy can see everything that I‚Äôm doing.‚Äù

Others had a more somber tone discussing their decisions to download RedNote, suggesting the U.S. government‚Äôs intention was to hurt its people, many of whom have built large followings and full-time careers on TikTok.

‚ÄúOur government, I‚Äôm convinced, loves and thrives seeing us unhappy and seeing us struggle and seeing us poor,‚Äù another TikToker said. ‚ÄúSeeing that RedNote, another Chinese app, which is owned and hosted in China, is the No. 1 app in the App Store today is just beautiful.‚Äù

When was RedNote released?

RedNote launched in 2013. While it grew steadily over the years, its biggest boom came during the pandemic, which is when it rose in popularity.

How many users are on the app?

RedNote has 300 million monthly active users, according to TechCrunch. TechCrunch reported that women are 79% of the user base.

Could RedNote be banned like TikTok?

Like TikTok and Lemon8, the short answer appears to be yes ‚Äî however, it is not as straightforward as it is for TikTok and Lemon8, whose parent company, ByteDance, is named in the law.

Experts noted that the law gives the executive branch the authority to deem a country a ‚Äúforeign adversary‚Äù and that in doing so it can choose to ban an app that comes from that country. In this case, China is already deemed a ‚Äúforeign adversary‚Äù in the TikTok ban, and therefore the executive branch could theoretically decide that other apps from China must be banned.

But lawmakers who crafted the bill said in interviews with The Washington Post that while it could be used for foreign-controlled social media platforms, the core intention of the ban was to target TikTok and its sister applications.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.3501803874969482,neutral,0.938088834285736,Anti-ban

I am saying this because not many people realize it. Tiktok was already set to die long before the ban. I am using my anecdotal evidence as someone in high-school at the moment.

Basically, long before the ban bill was even passed Tiktok was allready dwindling in popularity, most people were switching to Instagram reels and youtube shorts was used by the more nerdy groups. Tiktok was seen as a ""Old People"" app and not many people used it outside of the fact that all of their stuff was on there already.

During the Tiktok ban the app actually got more popular as more people (Like Me) started to join to see what we were missing, aost switched back to our old apps but some stayed. Most people aren't worried about the TIktok ban, they are just sad about their saved links getting deleted. So yeah, Tiktok was basically dying before the ban.

Here is some more information you should know:

1. Instagram is seen as the app for memes and humor
2. tiktok is seen as the app for sports and influencers
3. Youtube Shorts is seen as the app that 5th graders use
4. the only reason most people started with tiktok is because we were ushered in by the older kids

Also all of that Rednote crap is not actually popular with anyone, most people who are casual users of tiktok switched to Instagram last week. Rednote is just a solution for people who just really want that Chinese feel to their social media and want to ""Stick it to the big guy"" even though you cant make money off of it, and the fact that Rednote is a shopping app with a social media aspect and not the other way around.",post,reddit_praw_posts_2025.csv,0.2683846354484558,neutral,0.6808109879493713,Neutral

is a senior reporter specializing in investigative features about labor issues in the game industry, as well as the business and culture of games.

TikTok could shut off for United States-based users on Sunday, should the Supreme Court decide not to block a law that would otherwise ban the social media app, according to Reuters and The Information. The Supreme Court is currently weighing whether the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act ‚Äî the so-called TikTok ban ‚Äî is constitutional, and is expected to release its decision this week. Should the Supreme Court deem the ban constitutional, it would become illegal for app stores and internet services to distribute or host TikTok, and potentially other apps deemed a threat as controlled by a ‚Äúforeign adversary‚Äù; companies that defy this would face high fines. NBC News has suggested the justices are poised to uphold the ban.

Should the app go offline on Sunday, TikTok users attempting to open the app will find a pop-up message leading them to a website with information about the ban, per Reuters citing ‚Äúpeople familiar with the matter.‚Äù If the ban got reversed after the initial decision, Reuters said, TikTok would be restored ‚Äúin a relatively short time.‚Äù

Given TikTok‚Äôs reported readiness to pull the app offline, it feels increasingly unlikely that owner ByteDance will sell the app ahead of the deadline. The TikTok ban hinges on that: Legislators are pressuring the company to sell to an American company to keep it running in the U.S. The purported goal for the law is to keep Americans safe from ‚Äúforeign adversaries‚Äù like China. ByteDance is a Chinese-owned company.

However, U.S. TikTok users don‚Äôt seem too concerned by the supposed risk of using a Chinese app. In the lead-up to the Jan. 19 deadline, TikTok users have flocked to Chinese social media apps like Lemon8 and Xiaohongshu (called RedNote in English). These apps aren‚Äôt exact TikTok clones, but function similarly, allowing users to post shortform video content alongside microblogs and photo posts. Of course, it‚Äôs unknown how long these apps could be available to U.S. citizens. Owned by Chinese companies (Lemon8 is a ByteDance app), the law could apply to them, too.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.4043893814086914,neutral,0.9404370188713074,Neutral
2025-01-15T00:00:00Z,News,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/15/business/tiktok-shut-down/index.html,"TikTok is running out of time and options

CNN ‚Äî

As the clock ticks down on TikTok, it‚Äôs getting to be decision-making time.

The super-popular video app with 170 million American users and a China-based owner has less than 4 days left before it is banned in the United States if it doesn‚Äôt sell itself to an American buyer. The ban would go into effect Sunday, pending a Supreme Court decision that is expected to come soon (but it sure looks like America‚Äôs highest court will keep the law that bans TikTok in place).

TikTok‚Äôs owner, ByteDance, has a choice to make by Sunday, and its options are limited: Sell TikTok, shut it down, or try to keep the lights on long enough for President-elect Donald Trump to potentially come to the rescue. And, complicating matters further, those options aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive.

ByteDance has long been adamant: It says it has no intention of selling itself. TikTok‚Äôs magical algorithm that keeps you hooked on the app is its secret power, and putting a price tag on such a valuable commodity that every other social media app envies is difficult. Spinning off an American-only version of TikTok could also mean the rest of the world has to download a new app to access US users‚Äô content. Yet Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that China is weighing a sale ‚Äî to Elon Musk.

TikTok has fought the ban for years. But now, The Information says the app is preparing to shut itself down entirely Sunday, giving its users the option to collect their data ‚Äî but TikTok will effectively go dark Sunday. ByteDance did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday on the report from The Information.

Even if TikTok shuts itself down Sunday, that doesn‚Äôt mean it would go dark forever. It could ultimately sell itself to an American buyer down the road, which would presumably turn TikTok back on for American users. According to The Information, the app plans to give creators a means of downloading their old content if a shutdown takes place.

Another option: TikTok could do nothing. The law that goes into effect Sunday, pending the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision, doesn‚Äôt really force TikTok to do anything at all. It‚Äôs on the US-based companies that support TikTok to take action.

So, on Sunday, a very real possibility is that people don‚Äôt notice much of a change at all. Apple and Google probably will remove the app‚Äôs listing from their app stores, but people who already downloaded the app could continue to use it if TikTok did nothing.

That‚Äôs probably not a long-term viable option: No one would be able to access the app if they got a new phone or never downloaded the app in the first place, for example. And it would become illegal for companies like Oracle that host TikTok‚Äôs content in the United States to continue to serve it to the app‚Äôs users. That could force TikTok to serve content from outside the US, degrading customers‚Äô service.

Many TikTok users are clearly confused. Some posted videos this week were celebrating, incorrectly, claims that the ban had been extended another 270 days, an apparent reference to proposed legislation from a small group of senators to put off the deadline, which appears nowhere near to receiving a vote or being signed into law.

It‚Äôs all very murky and complicated ‚Äî which is why a clean break could be TikTok‚Äôs best option Sunday. Turning the lights off could rattle TikTok‚Äôs loyal fanbase, perhaps with the purposeful aim of gaining Trump‚Äôs attention.

Trump, who supported a TikTok ban as president, has recently done a 180 and said he no longer supports the ban. He even petitioned the Supreme Court to stay the law so his incoming administration could work out a deal to keep TikTok available to Americans.

The enforcement mechanism for the new law would be the US Justice Department, which is changing hands at noon the day after the ban and which would have wide discretion to enforce the law (or not). So if Trump says his administration won‚Äôt enforce the ban, TikTok may place a bet that all the companies that host and support TikTok‚Äôs content will be willing to break the letter of the law with the understanding that they won‚Äôt be punished for it.

That‚Äôs a big gamble.

That‚Äôs why Sunday could be a very painful day for thousands of creators who have built careers on TikTok. And that‚Äôs why, in the meantime, other video streaming apps are gaining steam, as creators are looking to maintain their online presence, business and following. Competing apps including RedNote, ByteDance‚Äôs Lemon8, Flip, Clapper and Fanbase are rising in popularity on the app store.

Still, the future of TikTok remains a giant question mark. TikTok may shut itself down only to later reappear ‚Äî with or without a US buyer. Sunday could be tough for TikTok fans. But Monday is a new day, with a new administration that could breathe new life into TikTok.

More than 700,000 US-based users have downloaded RedNote, a popular Chinese social app, as the TikTok ban deadline looms ‚Äî but they may find themselves looking for yet another TikTok alternative soon. A US official told CBS News that Xiaohongshu, the app more commonly referred to as RedNote, has many of the same issues that caused Congress to ban TikTok and that the app could eventually face a similar ban unless it divests from its China-based parent company.

‚ÄúThis appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it‚Äôs not divested,‚Äù the anonymous official told CBS News on Thursday, referring to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the bill under which Congress banned TikTok.

Among the problems lawmakers raised in the lead-up to the TikTok ban was the Chinese government‚Äôs sway over TikTok‚Äôs content moderation practices ‚Äî an issue that appears to apply to RedNote as well. Per The Information, RedNote has begun removing US users‚Äô posts that are considered ‚Äútoo sensitive‚Äù for the app, including posts discussing LGBTQ topics. Three people with knowledge of communications between RedNote and officials with the Cyberspace Administration of China told The Information that regulators are concerned about politically sensitive posts ‚Äî and Chinese officials told RedNote‚Äôs government relations team to ensure that users in China can‚Äôt see US users‚Äô posts.

Privacy advocates are also warning against using RedNote. In an emailed statement, Cooper Quintin, the senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said ‚Äúanyone for whom privacy is a matter of personal safety‚Äù should think twice before downloading RedNote, adding that the EFF has similar concerns about US-based apps like Facebook.

‚ÄúPeople looking for alternative social media apps should be cautious about the privacy implications of sharing information with an app that has not yet seen substantial public scrutiny outside of China,‚Äù Quintin said. ‚ÄúThis is certainly not a platform which values free speech ‚Äì it‚Äôs a heavily censored application on which topics such as political speech, drugs and addiction, and sexuality are more tightly controlled even than similar social networks. This is also not a platform that will protect you from US-based surveillance capitalism as it shares data with Facebook and Google ad networks.‚Äù",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.2139419913291931,neutral,0.8865633010864258,Pro-ban

Kesha is poking fun at the upcoming TikTok ban.

Following the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision to allow the TikTok ban to go into effect on Sunday, Jan. 19, the 37-year-old singer-songwriter shared an Instagram post joking that her fans will still have a ‚ÄúTiK ToK‚Äù to listen to.

She included a video of herself wearing a black hoodie and looking at the camera as the chorus of her popular song ‚ÄúTiK ToK‚Äù played in the background. Over the video, she wrote, ‚ÄúTikTok may be temporary, but TiK ToK is forever,‚Äù and captioned it with a peace sign emoji and a black heart emoji.

Kesha's post garnered responses from several fellow singers including Natasha Bedingfield, who wrote, ‚ÄúExactly!!!‚Äù Musician Hayley Kiyoko also praised the singer, commenting, ‚Äúicon.‚Äù

Several fans deemed Kesha ‚Äúthe original Queen of Tik Tok‚Äù in the comments. Another fan joked, ‚ÄúThere will ALWAYS be the one and ONLY Tik Tok!‚Äù while yet another commented, ‚ÄúTik Tok was here before and it will still be here after TikTok üíÖüëë.‚Äù

Kesha debuted her hit single in 2010, and it spent nine weeks in the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100. In the years since, the song has continued to flourish in pop culture. Last year, the singer even changed the first line of ‚ÄúTiK ToK,‚Äù which refers to Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs, amid his ongoing sexual abuse and sex trafficking allegations and lawsuits.

The line formerly went, ""Wake up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy."" While performing at Coachella with Rene√© Rapp, Kesha debuted the new lyrics, saying, ""Wake up in the morning feeling like, f--- P. Diddy!""

She opened up about the change in an August 2024 post on X, writing, ""TiK ToK was the first single that I put into this world that had my voice AND my name credited. I remember making it fun and happy because that‚Äôs how I felt and wanted others to feel.""

Noting that the song was released nearly 15 years ago, the singer said it reminds her of how she viewed the world at the time. ""That girl was na√Øve and wild and playful. This song eternalizes a side of myself that I love very much, and now see I have to protect fiercely. The world has changed so much and so have I,"" she added.

Kesha also noted that the ‚Äúnew lyric change‚Äù is ‚Äúpermanent,"" and that she would rerecord the song once she has the legal rights to do so.

TikTok is scheduled to shut down its app on Sunday after the Supreme Court ruling on Friday, Jan. 17. The ban is part of a legislation ‚Äî which was overwhelmingly passed by Congress and was signed by Biden last year ‚Äî that required the popular app‚Äôs Chinese owners, ByteDance, to sell it over fears China's government could use its data to manipulate or harm Americans.

TikTok has since pushed back, criticizing the sell-or-ban legislation as ‚Äúconceived and pushed through based on inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people.‚Äù",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.6269232034683228,amusement,0.5959138870239258,Anti-ban

Welcome back to Week in Review. This week, we‚Äôre looking at the impacts of the looming TikTok ban in the U.S., including the ‚ÄúTikTok refugees‚Äù moving to Chinese app RedNote, the surge of English speakers learning Mandarin on Duolingo, and more! Let‚Äôs get into it.

The Supreme Court upheld the law that will effectively ban TikTok tomorrow. The decision marks the end of TikTok‚Äôs monthslong legal fight against a law that essentially forces the app to shut down unless it divests its U.S. operations. Starting Sunday, it will be illegal for app stores and internet hosting services to distribute TikTok. The company warned that the app will ‚Äúgo dark‚Äù on Sunday, but it‚Äôs unclear what exactly will happen when the ban takes effect.

American users are flocking to RedNote, a Chinese short-form video app also known as Xiaohongshu, making it the No. 1 free app on the U.S. App Store. RedNote hits a lot of the right notes for creators looking for a TikTok alternative: It has a layout that‚Äôs similar to Pinterest‚Äôs, it is typically thought of as China‚Äôs answer to Instagram, and it boasts a number of social shopping features. But the transition hasn‚Äôt been easy for some people.

TikTok users are using Duolingo to learn Chinese in increasing numbers amid their adoption of RedNote ahead of the TikTok ban. According to Duolingo, the app has seen roughly 216% growth in new Mandarin learners in the U.S. compared to this time last year, with a sharp spike in mid-January as RedNote‚Äôs adoption took off.

A U.S. ban of TikTok began to take effect on Sunday, capping a high-stakes battle that pitted the federal government against one of the nation's most popular social media platforms.

Congress passed the measure last spring with overwhelming bipartisan support, granting TikTok a 270-day window to cut its ties with China-based parent company ByteDance or face a ban.

Instead of initiating a sale, however, TikTok pursued a legal challenge on First Amendment grounds that ended in failure at the Supreme Court on Friday.

The unanimous ruling from the nation's highest court found merit in national security concerns regarding potential user data collection or content manipulation that the Chinese government might undertake.

Yet the ultimate fate of TikTok remains uncertain. Rather than force TikTok to take the app dark, the ban targets third-party companies like cloud-service providers and app stores, meaning TikTok could circumvent such restrictions, at least temporarily.

The platform became unavailable for some users Saturday evening, with a popup message in the app saying, ""Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now."" By Sunday morning, App stores run by Apple, Google and Samsung began removing the app.

The Biden administration said earlier this week that it would not enforce the ban on Sunday, leaving implementation of the measure to President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Monday. Trump has vowed to reverse the ban.

Here's what could be next for TikTok.

TikTok's quality is expected to worsen

TikTok could remain available for U.S. users over the coming days and weeks but the app would likely degrade in quality, experts previously told ABC News.

The reason is because the ban would place restrictions on app stores and hosting companies, which provide the digital infrastructure on which web services like TikTok depend.

Mandatory withdrawal of the app from major app stores would not only bar new users from downloading the app, it also would prevent existing users from updating it.

Apple in a support update posted on Sunday said users who already installed ByteDance apps will be able to keep them on their device.

""But they can‚Äôt be redownloaded if deleted or restored if you move to a new device,"" Apple said. ""In-app purchases and new subscriptions are no longer possible.""

Without updates, the app would worsen in quality over time, some experts said ‚Äì for example, through inconveniences such as video-loading delays and performance glitches.

A separate stipulation in the ban would also make it illegal for hosting companies to provide services for TikTok. The measure offers a fairly broad characterization of such firms.

TikTok would stop functioning if the firm's U.S.-based hosting companies stopped providing services. However, the social media giant could establish partnerships with hosting companies outside the U.S., putting them out of reach of U.S. enforcement ‚Äì in theory, at least.

Such a move would keep TikTok available to U.S. users, but the service would likely be slower and glitchier as the digital infrastructure moves farther away, experts said.

Trump has vowed to reverse the ban

Trump is considering what executive actions he has available to allow TikTok to keep operating, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.

One option is an executive order that could attempt to direct the government to not enforce the law, but that avenue faces legal roadblocks, experts told ABC News, chief of which is that an executive order can't override a law that Congress has passed and that has now been upheld by the Supreme Court.

Trump's Justice Department could still opt against enforcement of the law, reassuring app stores and cloud-service providers that they wouldn't face prosecution in the event of a violation.

While the Justice Department has enforcement discretion, app providers like Apple and Google could still be subject to hefty fines under a law that has a five-year statute of limitations, which would extend it beyond the length of Trump's presidential term.

Pam Bondi, Trump's nominee for attorney general, declined to say during her confirmation hearing this week whether she would commit to enforcing the TikTok ban.

TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who will attend Trump's inauguration after receiving an invitation from the incoming administration, thanked Trump in a video posted to TikTok on Friday after the Supreme Court ruling.

""I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States. This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship,"" Chew said.

Congress may take up the ban a second time

TikTok may await a potential repeal of the law that banned the app in the first place.

A repeal would require passage in both houses of Congress, landing the measure on Trump's desk for his signature.

Congress voted in favor of the ban only nine months ago. In the House of Representatives, the ban passed by an overwhelming margin of 352-65. In the Senate, 79 members voted in favor of the measure, while 18 opposed and three abstained.

Since then, however, Trump has voiced his disapproval of the measure and Republicans have taken control of both chambers of Congress. Even so, whether such a repeal would make its way to the floor, and its fate should it do so, are impossible to forecast.

Man, it was a way to see unfiltered news, have a place where many people communicated with each other, many people made a living off of TikTok because of creator funds, many small business grew because of the shop and their algorithm, it‚Äôs the main gen z content app as more apps lean millennials and boomers, educate themselves, help people connect to other people around the world compared to other platforms where it focuses on your country and not only that but finally it also shows how censorship still happens in the U.S, how it‚Äôs turning into an Oligarchy and also how the U.S is not a representative democracy anymore.

I understand that there was a ton of bad people that blew up because of it or that people blew up for dumb reasons however how is this a good thing? If anything they‚Äôll just migrate to a new social media, not only that but it‚Äôs also a loud minority. People also say that it‚Äôs good because of China having our data which America already does all of that not only that but also the CEO has confirmed they don‚Äôt do that. Also people say it‚Äôs ruining attention spans, that would be a problem of the individual to self moderate not TikTok.

Can we not be so dramatic about the ban because if your making money off of Tiktock fine if your having a small business there fine but I am going to be irritating if I see one more YouTube short about a teenager crying about the ban because it's a social media app don't cry about it. I probably sound like I'm being grumpy right now but it's just irritating because personally I never had TikTok and was teased about it and it's annoying that some people are crying about it like your taking away my rights and freedom.

I don't even live in US but all this tiktok ban thing makes me feel sad. Just because it's happening to people somewhere.

Some say that it's for the better, but I can't believe they don't understand the platform is not the problem, the people are. I even think that if some platform has a toxic userbase, it should stay up, so those people won't go to other places with their toxicity.

And it's not just tiktok being banned after all. From what I've heard, it's the company that owns it. So also no mlbb, seemingly no capcut, and some other things probably.

And what also makes me sad is the fact that some people would see their favourite social media/game/whatever being gone from their country, and they would just go ""okay"". I don't tell to go fight the government, but installing a vpn is not that difficult. But some people are way too lazy to do even this. (not even talking about this exact situation, there are just people like this. maybe i shouldn't have talked about this at all here idk)

I might be overthinking all this, I most likely am overthinking. I guess I can't just live my life without worrying about something that happens on the other side of the globe. I try to be positive about everything but when something like this happens somewhere, I start to feel 'meh'.",post,reddit_praw_posts_2025.csv,0.454250693321228,sadness,0.8426676392555237,Anti-ban

Did you ever have to deal with the last guy to leave the party who wouldn't take the hint that the fun ended an hour ago and he's the only reason you aren't in bed already, sleeping it off? You finally maneuvered him to the front door, the Uber is honking in the driveway, but he won't wrap up the 12"" extended dance mix of ""Goodnight!"" and leave.

Presidentish Joe Biden has been on his way out the door since June, and that sound you hear outside is an Uber driver at the absolute end of his patience.

One empathizes.

Yet Biden isn't just a loudmouth partygoer who won't take a hint ‚Äî although he certainly is a loudmouth. His parting gifts to an ungrateful nation include various bans on oil drilling, entangling us deeper in Syria, pardons and commutations for everyone from his bagman/son to violent drug felons, selling off unused border wall material before the new administration can get to them, altering the order of succession at various federal departments to thwart Donald Trump from carrying out his campaign promises ‚Äî among others.

Biden is protecting Our Sacred Democracy, you see, because the people voted wrong.

And today's latest and most enraging, pre-emptive pardons for the entire Jan. 6 committee, Gen. Mark Milley, and that toxic Hobbit, celebrity medical spokesmodel Anthony Fauci.

Of course, Biden did none or very little of this himself. How much of what he affixes his signature he actually comprehends isn't known. However, a weekend report from the New York Times indicates that on a meter from ""None"" to ""All,"" the needle is firmly on the left-hand side.

How bad was it? Saturday, my Red State colleague Bonchie noted on X, ""Mike Johnson describing Joe Biden having no idea he had signed an EO banning LNG exports, instead believing he had just authorized a study, is the biggest presidential scandal in history.""

""Staffers were lying to Biden about EOs they wanted and getting him to sign them. Insane.""

As for that NYT report...

Had the weirdest dream. @nytimes published this big expos√© of the coverup of @JoeBiden‚Äôs mental and physical decline without apologizing for or even acknowledging their part in it and expected to be taken seriously. Wild. ‚Äî Stephen Green (@VodkaPundit) January 19, 2025

Word came out over the weekend that Biden will be writing his memoirs, and you can bet the next month's mortgage and car payment that Biden's book will be the extended play version of that crappy little speech he gave last week. ""I left the country with a booming economy, a secure border, world peace, and ‚Äî thanks to my administration ‚Äî Taco Tuesdays are now free for everybody.""

The most that can be said about Biden's farewell address, such as it was, is that it happened. Few heard it, and even fewer listened. When it was over, the impression was even less than if Biden had not spoken at all.

I will not read Biden's memoir, which will certainly be even less his work than anything ""he"" did as president.

2025-01-20T00:00:00Z,News,techcrunch.com,https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/rednote-flip-clapper-and-likee-claim-the-top-of-the-app-store-as-tiktok-comes-back-online/,"RedNote, Flip, Clapper, and Likee claim the top of the App Store as TikTok comes back online

TikTok may be back, but that hasn‚Äôt prevented other Chinese competitors from gaining users. In the lead-up to a ban on TikTok ‚Äî which kicked off Sunday and lasted a day ‚Äî a number of other video apps rose through the ranks and now dominate the App Store‚Äôs Top Charts.

The Chinese app RedNote (which is listed on the app stores as Xiaohongshu) became the No. 1 app in the U.S. last week, followed by video apps like Clapper, Flip, and others. On Monday, following TikTok‚Äôs restoration of service, RedNote retained its No. 1 spot on the App Store, after having attracted some 700,000 new U.S. users.

TikTok users‚Äô move to RedNote was meant to send a signal to U.S. lawmakers and Meta alike that they would rather join another Chinese app similar to TikTok than return to Instagram Reels.

Though TikTok is back online, the app stores aren‚Äôt yet hosting it for download; app marketplaces still have to abide by U.S. law, despite President Trump‚Äôs assurances that he will extend the deadline for the TikTok ban.

Instead, both app stores‚Äô top charts continue to reflect the shift to other TikTok alternatives.

In Apple‚Äôs U.S. App Store, for instance, video apps such as RedNote, Likee, Clapper, and Flip hold the No. 1, 2, 4, and 10 spots, respectively, in the Overall Top Charts as of Monday morning. Favorited, an app dedicated to livestreams, is No. 15.

Social network Bluesky also just added an optional custom video feed, but its app has dropped out of the top 10 position it held last week on the U.S. App Store. It‚Äôs No. 13 as of Monday morning on the App Store and No. 15 on Google Play.

Still, Bluesky gained a few more downloads thanks to the TikTok ban and now has 28.29 million users, up from 27.5 million last week.

According to estimates from app store intelligence provider Appfigures, RedNote, Flip, and Clapper all saw a massive growth spurt last week from single-digit thousand downloads per day earlier in January to tens of thousands of U.S. downloads on Friday.

RedNote, meanwhile, was receiving hundreds of thousands of downloads.

RedNote gained 818,000 new U.S. installs across the App Store and Google Play during January 2025. Because the app is localized in Mandarin, language learning app Duolingo also reported a 216% spike in U.S. users trying to learn the language last week.

Currently, it‚Äôs the No. 1 app in the U.S. on the U.S. App Store and Google Play, excluding games.

Clapper, a TikTok alternative aimed at teens and adults ages 17 and up, gained 646,000 downloads on the App Store and Google Play in the U.S. On Friday, it added 87,000 new downloads, or 1,030% more than the 7,000 new downloads it saw back on January 1, Appfigures reports. It‚Äôs now the No. 4 top app (excluding games) on the U.S. App Store and No. 2 on Google Play.

Likee, a short video app, is No. 2 on the U.S. App Store and No. 3 on Google Play. It saw a massive surge of growth, moving from No. 202 on the U.S. App Store on Saturday to No. 2 by 3 a.m. on Sunday, Appfigures says. In total, it saw 283,000 downloads during January so far. On Google Play, it jumped to the No. 8 position across both apps and games on Sunday night and has since dropped to No. 11. It‚Äôs currently the No. 3 app (excluding games).

For Android users, the short video app Scoopz made it into the No. 4 position on Google Play while the short drama app ReelShort is No. 7 on Google Play‚Äôs list of top apps, excluding games.

Lastly, Flip, which focuses on social commerce, grew by 580,000 downloads in January, the data indicates. (However, Flip also ran many TikTok ads over the past week, leading to those gains.) It‚Äôs No. 10 on the U.S. App Store and No. 9 on Google Play‚Äôs top charts, excluding games.

Despite many TikTok users signaling that they wouldn‚Äôt use Instagram, Meta‚Äôs app continued to hold a high rank on both app stores, including No. 8 on the U.S. Apple App Store Top Apps chart and No. 5 on Google Play‚Äôs Top Apps chart as of Monday morning.

VPN apps saw a brief surge too

After the TikTok ban went into effect, U.S. users immediately tried installing VPN apps to work around the restrictions to no avail. (TikTok‚Äôs mobile app remained blocked even when VPNs were used).

Still, this temporarily drove a number of new U.S. users to VPN apps like VPN ‚Äî Super Unlimited Proxy, which grew from the No. 91 app to the No. 3 app within 36 hours. Another VPN app, Fast VPN Super, climbed 155 spots during that same time, and Nord VPN hit No. 9 after climbing 160 spots in the top charts.

Other apps that rose hundreds of spots overnight after the ban included X-VPN, Proton VPN, Free VPN .org, and Express VPN.

The app store charts are likely to soon shift again as U.S. users realize they can return to TikTok and decide to move away from at least some of their recent backup choices for a replacement.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.8265296220779419,neutral,0.8380519151687622,Anti-ban

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called into question the U.S.' commitment to its transatlantic allies, saying President Donald Trump's decision to focus on domestic issues as his first act in office suggested he would not be concerned with the future of Europe.

""Right now, all eyes are on Washington, but who's actually watching Europe at the moment?"" Zelenskyy asked the audience of business leaders and heads of state gathered in Davos, Switzerland, during his address on Tuesday.

Zelenskyy looked to appeal to European officials and business, warning that the region's security was at risk, as Trump had shown where his priorities lie through his first executive orders, signed after his inauguration Monday.

Pausing the TikTok ban instituted in the last days of the administration of his predecessor Joe Biden, declaring a national border emergency and a retreat from climate goals were among the orders that Trump inked in his first act as the 47th president of the United States.

""Will President Trump even notice Europe? Does he see NATO as necessary, and will he respect EU institutions?"" Zelenskyy asked, noting that global relationships are shifting, with Europe now concerned that the U.S. could and would abandon it at a time of need. Washington does not share this worry, Zelenskyy claimed.

""Does anyone in the United States worry that Europe might abandon them some day, might stop being their ally? The answer is 'no',"" he told delegates.

""Europe can't afford to be second or third in line of [U.S.] allies. If that happens, the world will start moving forward without Europe ... Europe needs to compete for the top spot in priorities, alliances and technological development.""

The region must establish itself as a ""strong, global player,"" the Ukrainian leader said.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.7512715458869934,neutral,0.8453474044799805,Neutral

China Battle Marvel Video Game Shut Down: How Disney Got Caught Up In TikTok Ban - Walt Disney (NYSE

A highly publicized ban of TikTok by the U.S. led to other apps getting caught in the crossfire, including a game featuring Marvel superheroes. Here's a look at what happened and what the executive order signed by President Donald Trump means for the game's future.

What Happened: The Supreme Court recently upheld a ban on TikTok in the U.S., following a congressional ruling that parent company ByteDance would have to divest the U.S. division of the company by Jan. 19.

While TikTok went dark briefly over the weekend, an executive order signed by Trump provided an additional lifeline for ByteDance for 75 days.

Along with TikTok going dark on app stores from Alphabet Inc GOOGGOOGL and Apple Inc AAPL as part of the pending ban, other apps owned by ByteDance companies also disappeared from the stores and for a brief time were unusable.

This includes Marvel Snap, a mobile collectible card game that features characters from the Marvel Universe. The game was developed by Second Dinner and published by Nuverse, a ByteDance subsidiary, in 2022, as reported by USA Today.

The game uses Marvel characters from the comic book company owned by Walt Disney Co DIS.

A search for Marvel Snap on the Google Play Store Tuesday brought up other Marvel titles with the app still unavailable for download. Existing owners of the app saw service restored in the U.S, as reported by The Verge. The ban also impacted the PC version of the game, according to the company's announcement of the ban.

""Unfortunately, Marvel Snap is temporarily unavailable in U.S. app stores and is unavailable to play in the U.S. In a surprise to Second Dinner and our publisher Nuverse, Marvel Snap was affected by the takedown of TikTok late on Saturday, January 18,"" Second Dinner said previously.

Second Dinner Chief Development Officer Ben Brode told followers on social media that no warning was given to the company or Nuverse that their app would be part of the ban.

Why It's Important: The ban of ByteDance apps was a large talking point mainly around TikTok, but several other apps were hurt by the ruling and are now affected.

Along with Marvel Snap, here are some other apps that ByteDance owns or controls that faced a similar fate.

Lemon8 : social media platform

: social media platform CapCut : video editing software

: video editing software Gauth: artificial intelligence homework aid

artificial intelligence homework aid Hypic : photo editing software

: photo editing software Lark: enterprise collaboration platform

Based on the timing of the ban still pending, these apps and the Marvel game could continue to be disallowed in app stores and could go dark in the future.

Second Dinner is ready to ensure this doesn't happen again by making changes.

""Marvel Snap is back online in the U.S. But to make sure this NEVER happens again, we're working to bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher. This is the start of a new era for Marvel Snap."" the company shared on social media.

Golden Era: 2019 - 2020

Alternatively, you might include 2021 in the golden age making it:

Golden: 2019 - 2021

Silver: 2022 - 2023

Bronze: 2024 - 2025

New York CNN ‚Äî

A board member at TikTok‚Äôs parent company said that a deal to save the app from disappearing in the United States will be done soon.

General Atlantic CEO Bill Ford, a ByteDance board member, said Wednesday that it‚Äôs in ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs interest‚Äù to keep the app active. Ford made the remarks at an Axios-sponsored event in Davos, Switzerland.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get on with it, as soon as maybe the end of the week in terms of negotiating what might work‚Ä¶ The Chinese government, the US government and the company and the board all have to be involved in this conversation,‚Äù Ford said, adding that there could be solutions ‚Äúshort of divestiture.‚Äù General Atlantic is a major investor in TikTok-owner ByteDance.

One of President Donald Trump‚Äôs first acts after taking office Monday was signing an executive action that delays enforcement of the TikTok ban for 75 days. The action directs the US Justice Department not to enforce the Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which passed with broad bipartisan support in Congress and was signed in April by former President Joe Biden.

The law required that starting January 19, TikTok be banned in the US unless it sells to a buyer from America or one of its allies. Trump told reporters that he would be open to the sale of only a 50% stake , and that he changed his mind on TikTok because he ‚Äúgot to use it.‚Äù

Trump is also talking about TikTok as a deal-making exercise, saying Tuesday that ‚ÄúI have the right to make a deal‚Äù and rhetorically repositioning the US law banning TikTok as a big business opportunity for the US and his tech mogul friends. Trump added that said he would be open to X owner Elon Musk or Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison taking over the app. Investor groups led by billionaire Frank McCourt and YouTuber and TikTok star Jimmy Donaldson, also known as MrBeast, also have made bids for TikTok for undisclosed sums.

For now, TikTok‚Äôs ultimate fate in America remains in doubt until a deal is made. It‚Äôs unclear that ByteDance would want to sell, even if it were a deal brokered by Trump.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.4110629558563232,neutral,0.8742085695266724,Neutral

Let me give you a run down of my day:

1st period: acquaintance of mine starts talking about being Christian in class - cool good for her, at least 1/4 of my school is christian. Although it does make me worry about what she thinks of me.

2nd period - a normal period thank goodness. Well besides the fact that they are going to ban cell phones. For now we can have them just have to be in our bags and can't be out during class at all.

3rd - my best friend is in that class, yay!! Probably will get a seating chart and won't be able to sit with her but it's okay ig. I was a but worried I will annoy her by being in the same class and talking to her but that is kinda stupid.

4th - lunch, loud obnoxious kids are by the hall we sit in as normal. Yelling about stuff and making homophobic jokes.

5th - new class, I know no one. One kid I know walked in but didn't sit by me (cool we aren't friends it's fine). The kids are loud and annoying. ""Trmp is banning men from womens sports"" ""yay!"" ""As he should"" ""didn't he also unban tiktok?"" ""Yeah"" ""well technically the executive people signed-"" 

Okay then

6th - chill class, brothers friend is in it. Friends crush is in it. Barely any people at all. Talk about how they will literally spend over 75k to buy cell phone locked bag things.

7th - terrifying, my old favorite class may be my new nightmare lol.

Anyway pretty chill day actually. The transphobia I overheard wasn't that bad but it is always weird to hear. My school doesn't have many bullies or anything so I'm pretty safe. The general hostile feel is uncomfortable but not too bad. I've basically gone back into the closet, I have a pronoun pin and will say I'm LGBTQ if asked but generally I won't correct anyone, I won't stick up for myself.

TikTok is staying in the U.S. for now, but its future remains uncertain.

President Donald Trump this week paused a ban on the app and said he has ""the right to make a deal"" to try to save it. Legal experts questioned whether he can override a federal law that bans it. And the app's China-based parent company appeared open to brokering an agreement.

General Atlantic CEO Bill Ford, a board member of TikTok's parent company ByteDance, said he is ""optimistic we will find a solution,‚Äù Bloomberg reported Thursday.

‚ÄúThere are a number of alternatives we can talk to President Trump and his team about that are short of selling the company that allow the company to continue to operate, maybe with a change of control of some kind, but short of having to sell,"" Ford told Bloomberg Television.

Trump signed an executive order on Monday that delays enforcement of a TikTok ban until April. The ban resulted from a law that required its sale to a non-Chinese company by Jan. 19. TikTok briefly shut down in the U.S. as the deadline approached but restarted after Trump pledged his support.

Trump later told reporters he's looking to have the U.S. government broker a deal for 50% control of the app, and would be open to Elon Musk or Oracle's Larry Ellison purchasing it. Trump said he believes the app is worth $1 trillion.

‚ÄúGive half to the United States of America and we‚Äôll give you the permit,‚Äù Trump said, calling the platform ‚Äúworthless‚Äù without a permit.

Related TikTok alternatives to migrate to

TikTok's days had appeared numbered after the Supreme Court on Jan. 17 unanimously upheld the federal law requiring its sale. The Court sided with the U.S. government, which argued the app poses a national security risk because it can track and collect data on 170 million American users.

Trump tried to ban TikTok during his first term and find an American buyer before he lost his reelection bid.

He said last year that he still had concerns TikTok carries security risks, but that young people would go ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù without it. After using it to court younger voters, Trump said he had found ""a warm spot"" for the app.

TikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Trump's swearing-in, and the platform hosted an inauguration party in Washington that featured right-wing content creators.

""We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,"" TikTok told Business Insider.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.41614830493927,neutral,0.7850340604782104,Neutral

I have two accounts, one is American location and changed because I moved to America recently, so I can't change location on that(as far as I know)

my second account is probably still on Germany region, yet says Tiktok downloads are paused.

for my second account, when I go to the screen with the country, it gives me the option of PayPal or Card (I do not have a purchasing system set up) and when I click it it asks me if I want to change my location to America. So why does it not work?

On the eve of Saturday, Jan. 18, TikTok went dark in the U.S. in response to a federal ban, after the U.S. government raised concerns about the app‚Äôs China-based owner ByteDance and the access it might have to U.S. data. But the social media platform restored service to its U.S. users the very next day‚Äîciting a promised executive order from President Donald Trump, who was then just one day away from his Inauguration Address.

After being sworn in, Trump signed an executive order granting TikTok a 75-day extension to comply with a law that requires a sale or ban of the platform, instructing the Attorney General to not enforce the law while he bides time for the app to be sold.

As Trump gives ByteDance more time to find an appropriate buyer, many moguls and businesses have thrown their hats in the ring for a chance to purchase the social media platform‚Äîa bid that could be as much as $50 billion, per an estimate by CFRA Research's Senior Vice President Angelo Zino.

While ByteDance had initially been opposed to selling the app‚Äôs U.S. operations, General Atlantic CEO Bill Ford (General Atlantic is a major investor in ByteDance), told Axios on Wednesday, Jan. 22, that a deal will get done because ‚Äúit's in everybody's interest.""

With discussions circulating about potential deals, here‚Äôs what you need to know about the top contenders to buy and ‚Äúsave‚Äù TikTok in the U.S.

Elon Musk

Listed by Forbes as the world‚Äôs richest person, Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk has found his name used widely among those discussing potential TikTok buyers.

Trump said he would be comfortable with Musk‚Äîwho he has entrusted to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)‚Äî buying TikTok.

When asked by reporters on Jan. 22 if he was ‚Äúopen‚Äù to Musk purchasing the app, Trump said: ‚ÄúI would be if he wanted to buy it.‚Äù

Read More: How Elon Musk Became a Kingmaker

In mid-January, before the short-lived TikTok ban went into effect, Bloomberg released a report that China was considering Musk as a buyer for the app.

However, TikTok responded via a cool statement shared with several outlets: ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt be expected to comment on pure fiction.‚Äù

Musk has posted on X (formerly Twitter) about his opposition to the ban‚Äîcalling it an exercise in ‚Äúcensorship and government control‚Äù‚Äîbut he has not publicly stated if he has plans to buy the app or if it was a consideration at any point.

MrBeast

Content creator Jimmy Donaldson, known on the Internet as MrBeast, has made it clear he is interested in buying TikTok. Donaldson has the most subscribers of any user on YouTube‚Äî over 340 million‚Äîand boasts over 113 million TikTok followers.

On Jan. 13, Donaldson began discussion of his potential bid for TikTok with a post on X that read: ‚ÄúOkay fine, I‚Äôll buy Tik Tok so it doesn‚Äôt get banned‚Äù In a video posted on Jan. 15, Donaldson then told his followers: ‚ÄúI just got out of a meeting with a bunch of billionaires. TikTok, we mean business.‚Äù

On Monday, Jan. 20, Donaldson posted another update. ‚ÄúTikTok, I‚Äôm on a private jet right now about to put in my official offer for this platform,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI might become your guys‚Äô new CEO.‚Äù

The Associated Press reported that Donaldson had joined a consortium of investors, led by Employer.com founder and CEO Jesse Tinsley, in their bid for TikTok. Tinsley announced that the consortium made a formal, all-cash offer to purchase TikTok's U.S. operations and assets.

‚ÄúOur offer represents a win-win solution that preserves this vital platform, while addressing legitimate national security concerns,‚Äù said Tinsley. The statement did not disclose the amount of the bid.

Kevin O'Leary

Kevin O‚ÄôLeary, Canadian investor and star of the reality television show Shark Tank, has expressed a strong interest in buying TikTok. He has joined ‚ÄúThe People‚Äôs Bid for TikTok,‚Äù an effort led by Project Liberty Founder Frank McCourt.

On Fox‚Äôs America‚Äôs Newsroom on Jan. 17, O‚ÄôLeary said that ‚Äú$20 billion is on the table. Cash.‚Äù

And on social media, the business mogul pitted himself against fellow bidder Donaldson by posting his segment on Fox, the thumbnail reading: ‚ÄúIs MrBeast really the competition?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly one group has the tech to pull this off without breaking a sweat. Guess who?‚Äù O‚ÄôLeary said in his Instagram caption. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been pitching the solution on Capitol Hill. If this deal happens, it‚Äôs going to rewrite the rules of social media power, all on American terms.‚Äù

Read More: Why Trump Flipped on TikTok

Trump has stated that he would ‚Äúlike the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture.‚Äù

O‚ÄôLeary is keen on this idea, but told CNBC that he has concerns. ‚ÄúThat 50/50 deal, I would love to work with Trump on, so would every other potential buyer... But the problem with some of these ideas is they are inconsistent with the ruling of the Supreme Court,‚Äù he said

Larry Ellison

While speaking from the White House, Trump stated that he would like Oracle chief technology officer and cofounder Larry Ellison to buy TikTok.

In front of reporters, he turned to Ellison and said: ‚ÄúLarry, lets negotiate in front of the media. So what I‚Äôm thinking about saying to someone is, ‚ÄòBuy it, and give half to the United States of America.‚Äô‚Äù

He then asked Ellison if it sounded ‚Äúreasonable,‚Äù with Ellison responding: ‚ÄúSounds like a good deal to me, Mr. President.‚Äù

Ellison, an ally to the President, previously made a bid for TikTok back in 2020, when Trump pushed for a ban on the platform during his first term at the White House.

On Jan. 25, NPR reported that the Trump Administration is negotiating a deal that involves Oracle and a group of external investors to effectively take over TikTok‚Äôs global operations. In the deal, ByteDance would keep a stake in the company, but Oracle‚Äîwhich already provides the foundation of TikTok's web infrastructure‚Äîwould oversee the algorithm, data collection, and software updates.

Steven Mnuchin

Steven Mnuchin, the former U.S. Treasury Secretary who served during Trump‚Äôs first term, has re-entered discussions surrounding the purchase of TikTok.

In early 2024, Mnuchin said he was assembling an investor group to acquire the social media platform, back when the bipartisan bill to ban the app was just moving through the House of Representatives.

Mnuchin recently joined host David Faber on CNBC‚Äôs Squawk on the Street on Jan. 21, where Faber followed up on Mnuchin‚Äôs former interest in TikTok.

‚ÄúWe only put it on hold because it was clear that China was not willing to negotiate. Now that President Trump is willing to look at a deal, obviously we‚Äôre going to follow this very closely over the next 75 days,‚Äù Mnuchin said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd be very interested in investing [in] the business; it‚Äôs a terrific business, and we‚Äôd have a technology plan to rebuild the technology.‚Äù

Perplexity AI

Perplexity is ‚Äúa free AI-powered answer engine,‚Äù that arguably competes with the likes of OpenAI and Google.

Perplexity AI reportedly made a bid to merge with TikTok on Saturday, Jan. 18, with the understanding it would allow most of ByteDance‚Äôs existing investors to retain their equity stake.

On Jan. 26, the AP reported that Perplexity AI presented a new proposal to ByteDance‚Äîone that would allow the U.S. government to own up to half of that merged entity after a future initial public offering of at least $300 billion.

Microsoft

Responding to reporters, Trump said on Jan. 27 that Microsoft was also among those in current talks to acquire TikTok‚Äôs U.S. business.

Microsoft was among the top bidders for TikTok in 2020, eventually losing to Oracle and Walmart‚Äîthough a sale then eventually fell through. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella later described the failed deal as ""the strangest thing"" he had ever worked on.

President Donald Trump's executive order gave TikTok some breathing room after its U.S. ban briefly went into effect on Sunday.

However, it's not all smooth sailing for the video app owned by the Beijing-based ByteDance. Users trying to install it (or install it again after deleting it) on their phones are being blocked from downloading the app through Google Play or the Apple App Store.

Here's what's happening.

Why is TikTok back? Trump's executive order unbanned app

President Trump issued an executive order Monday aiming to halt enforcement of a ban on TikTok in the U.S. for 75 days, USA TODAY reports. It was one of his first orders following his inauguration.

TikTok shut down in the U.S. on Sunday, only to say it was working to restore service based on assurances from Trump.

Why can't I download the TikTop app?

According to USA TODAY, Google and Apple may be awaiting additional protections before bypassing the ban, which could levy punishments against companies for distributing the app, according to analysts, per a report from Reuters.

What happens if you search for TikTok in Google Play or the Apple App Store?

Android users searching for TikTok in the Google Play Store get an unclickable icon of the TikTok logo along with a question: ""Looking for TikTok?""

For iPhone users, those searching for TikTok see a notice reading, ""TikTok and other ByteDance apps are not available in the country or region you're in.""

Big money: iPhones with TikTok installed listed for thousands of dollars on eBay after brief ban

iPhones with TikTok already installed listed for tens of thousands on eBay

Meanwhile, some people believe their phones with the TikTok app are worth a fortune. Listings on eBay range from several hundred to tens of thousands of dollars. Phones with TikTok for sale on Friday morning were an iPhone 8 for $700, an iPhone 14 for $8,000 and an iPhone 15 Pro Max for $20,000.

Other eBay users have listed iPhones with TikTok installed for prices between $500 and $25,000 depending on the model and condition, USA TODAY reports. The $25,000 listing from a seller in Whittier, North Carolina, is for an iPhone 16 Pro Max with ""TIKTOK INSTALLED.""

GameStop buying phones with TikTok installed

GameStop wants in on the game, too. The retailer posted a message on social media this week: ""The rumors are true. GameStop will buy your phone with TikTok. Check the link in bio to find your trade value now.""

GameStop offers trade-ins on video games and started accepting smartphones around 2013, according to Dextero, a website that reports on gaming, esports, TV and movies. The retailer has expanded what it sells over the years, and therefore has expanded what it takes in trade. Dextero reports GameStop now accepts trades on tables and wearables like the Apple Watch.

Why was TikTok banned?

The ban was signed into law in April 2024 by former President Joe Biden, USA TODAY reported. The legislation, which received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, per USA TODAY, gave ByteDance up to a year to sell the app.

That law came on the heels of years of national debate surrounding potential national security risks posed by the platform. In November 2022, FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress that he was ‚Äúextremely concerned‚Äù the Chinese government could weaponize the data collected through TikTok, USA TODAY wrote.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.2442327141761779,neutral,0.6292816996574402,Neutral
2025-01-24T00:00:00Z,News,breitbart.com,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/01/24/boycott-fail-engagement-remains-steady-for-mark-zuckerbergs-meta-despite-leftist-outcry/,"Boycott Fail: Engagement Remains Steady for Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs Meta Despite Leftist Outcry

Recent data from multiple analytics firms suggests that calls for a boycott of Meta‚Äôs platforms have had little impact on user engagement, despite Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs decision to cut biased left-wing ‚Äúfact checking‚Äù programs and the Silicon Valley giant‚Äôs DEI initiatives.

Business Insider reports that in the wake of Meta‚Äôs announcement that it would eliminate its biased third-party ‚Äúfact checking‚Äù and scale back its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, thousands of users expressed their intention to leave the company‚Äôs platforms. However, data from several market intelligence firms indicate that these calls for a boycott have not significantly affected user engagement on Meta‚Äôs core platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram.

According to Apptopia, a market intelligence firm, Facebook‚Äôs daily active users (DAUs) initially declined by about two percent year-over-year following the policy changes. However, this trend was quickly reversed after news of a potential TikTok ban in the United States surfaced, prompting users to return to Meta‚Äôs platforms. Instagram experienced an even stronger rebound, with DAUs rising above the previous year‚Äôs levels on January 18, 19, and 20.

Thomas Grant, vice president of research at Apptopia, stated, ‚ÄúThe data ‚Äî especially the number of daily active users (DAUs) ‚Äî tells the story that usage started to fall after all the headlines came out about the changes Meta was making. But, then the news about the potential TikTok ban changed that trend and people started engaging with the [apps] more again.‚Äù

Interestingly, a survey conducted by CivicScience found that 36 percent of the 1,346 American participants supported Meta‚Äôs decision to replace fact-checking with Community Notes, compared to 32 percent who opposed the move. Support was particularly strong among Gen Z users aged 18-24, with 53 percent backing the changes.

Data from App Figures, another market intelligence firm, revealed that while US downloads for Facebook and Instagram declined slightly following the policy changes (eight percent and five percent, respectively), the revenue generated from in-app purchases on these platforms increased during the same period. Globally, Instagram‚Äôs downloads increased by five percent, while Facebook saw a modest one percent uptick.

Randy Nelson, head of insights at App Figures, stated, ‚ÄúAfter looking at the download and revenue data for Meta‚Äôs social apps, I was unable to detect any substantial or out-of-the-ordinary decline. In fact, in some cases there were increases.‚Äù

Sensor Tower, yet another market intelligence firm, found that user activity across Meta‚Äôs apps has remained steady since the policy changes. Only Instagram experienced a brief one percent weekly decrease in average DAUs immediately following the announcements but quickly recovered the following week.

The data suggests that despite the calls for a boycott, Meta‚Äôs platforms, which boast more than three billion users worldwide, remain firmly entrenched. The potential TikTok ban in the United States may have overshadowed concerns about Meta‚Äôs policy changes, as users sought alternative short-form video platforms like Instagram Reels.

In a scoop from National Public Radio on Saturday, it appears that there might actually be a resolution forthcoming to the complicated situation the Trump White House recently found itself in about the United States' TikTok ban. The ban, passed by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden, states that TikTok would need to find non-Chinese ownership or be banned from use in the country.

When we last wrote about this story, just hours before President Trump was set to be sworn in as the 47th president, he spoke about how he might halt the ban on TikTok, by issuing an executive order, stating that the ban would not take effect for up to 90 days.

Then on Day One of his return to the presidency, Trump signed an EO pausing the ban for 75 days, after the Supreme Court did not pause the law taking effect on Jan. 20. And as many people know, TikTok went dark for part of a day, before returning in the U.S.

Trump Puts the Brakes on the TikTok Ban for Now With Executive Order

BREAKING: Supreme Court Rules on TikTok Ban

Here's what NPR is reporting:

The Trump administration is working on a plan to save TikTok that involves tapping software company Oracle and a group of outside investors to effectively take control of the app's global operations, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks. Under the deal now being negotiated by the White House, TikTok's China-based owner ByteDance would retain a minority stake in the company, but the app's algorithm, data collection and software updates will be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok's web infrastructure. ... ""The goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok,"" said the person directly involved in the talks, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deliberations. ""ByteDance wouldn't completely go away, but it would minimize Chinese ownership."" Other potential investors who are engaged in the talks include Microsoft.

This isn't the first--or even second--time that Oracle has been mentioned as part of a White House-shepherded acquisition deal of the CCP-connected social media platform owned by ByteDance:

Back in 2020, Trump gave his blessing to a TikTok takeover attempt involving Oracle and Walmart that eventually fell apart. A source close to the discussions said the retailer is, at this point, sitting out after balking at the estimated price of the viral video app.

Then during the Biden administration, another potential solution to TikTok's tethering to the Chinese Communist Party--involving the tech company--fell through:

A national security plan that also involved Oracle, known as Project Texas ‚Äî which gained momentum during the Biden administration ‚Äî fell short of guaranteeing TikTok's independence from ByteDance, the staffer noted, but would not elaborate, saying it involves a security vulnerability that could have given China access to the data of American users.

Readers might recall that Trump recently floated the idea of the U.S. owning half of TikTok; this potential resolution reported about Saturday does not clarify that--at least, not according to one of the people NPR spoke to:

Some have suggested this means Trump is pushing for a partial nationalization of TikTok, others have chalked it up to imprecise language for a situation in which American private investors hold a 50% ownership stake in the company. ""Nobody seems to know what he means with the 50% equity comments,"" the source involved in the talks said.

Advertisement

Congressional approval of any deal would seem to be one of the major obstacles, as the some members and many Americans continue to express major concerns that China and/or ByteDance could essentially Trojan Horse their way into controlling the app's software:

A congressional staffer involved in talks about TikTok's future, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said binding legal agreements from the White House ensuring ByteDance cannot covertly manipulate the app will prove critical in winning lawmakers' approval. ""A key part is showing there is no operational relationship with ByteDance, that they do not have control,"" the Congressional staffer said. ""There needs to be no backdoors where China can potentially gain access.""

It would also need to be signed off on by both Google and Apple, who have not returned the TikTok app to its stores for users to download since the ban went into effect.

The report continued with what the next steps appear to be, as soon as next week:

Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, according to the source involved in the discussions, who said Oracle is interested in a TikTok stake ""in the tens of billions,"" but the rest of the deal is in flux.

Obviously, it's still early days--both in the new administration and the tweaking of the way this TikTok deal might work--but it's certainly an intriguing concept. NPR noted that Walmart, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and the White House did not respond to requests for comment on the story.

The Trump administration is working on a plan to save TikTok that involves tapping software company Oracle and a group of outside investors to effectively take control of the app's global operations, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks.

Under the deal now being negotiated by the White House, TikTok's China-based owner ByteDance would retain a minority stake in the company, but the app's algorithm, data collection and software updates will be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok's web infrastructure.

That would effectively mean American investors would own a majority stake in TikTok, but the terms of the deal could change and are still being hammered out.

""The goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok,"" said the person directly involved in the talks, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deliberations. ""ByteDance wouldn't completely go away, but it would minimize Chinese ownership.""

NPR has agreed not to name the sources, who are not authorized to speak publicly about the confidential talks.

Other potential investors who are engaged in the talks include Microsoft.

Back in 2020, Trump gave his blessing to a TikTok takeover attempt involving Oracle and Walmart that eventually fell apart. A source close to the discussions said the retailer is, at this point, sitting out after balking at the estimated price of the viral video app.

Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, according to the source involved in the discussions, who said Oracle is interested in a TikTok stake ""in the tens of billions,"" but the rest of the deal is in flux.

Spokespeople for Microsoft and Walmart declined to comment. TikTok, Oracle and the White House did not return a request for comment.

When asked about the Oracle talks on Air Force One on Saturday night, Trump denied being in discussions with Oracle's Larry Ellison about a TikTok takeover.

""Larry is a friend of mine,"" Trump said. ""I never spoke to Larry about TikTok. I've spoken to many people about TikTok. There's great interest in TikTok,"" he said.

Appeasing Congress

While estimates vary on how much TikTok's global business is worth, negotiators in the White House have said ByteDance believes it could fetch at least $200 billion, putting it well outside the reach of any of the consortium of investors who have been promoting their bids, according to the source involved in the discussions.

Another person who has sat in on conversations with senior White House officials about a TikTok deal said appeasing Congress is seen as a key hurdle.

Under a law passed by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court, TikTok must execute what is known as ""qualified divestiture"" from ByteDance in order to stay in business in the U.S. Trump is given wide latitude to interpret what that means, but experts say it could involve ByteDance retaining a minority stake in the company.

The app has passed its Jan. 19 deadline for achieving that splitting off from ByteDance, but President Trump has issued an executive order intended to provide a 75-day extension, though legal experts say the action cannot supersede the now-passed deadline set forth by Congress.

A congressional staffer involved in talks about TikTok's future, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said binding legal agreements from the White House ensuring ByteDance cannot covertly manipulate the app will prove critical in winning lawmakers' approval.

""A key part is showing there is no operational relationship with ByteDance, that they do not have control,"" the Congressional staffer said. ""There needs to be no backdoors where China can potentially gain access.""

Fears about China

Eliminating all potential ways for Chinese authorities to access TikTok's data and algorithm has been a concern among technology experts for years.

""The question that has always been difficult to answer is how do you prove a negative? How do you prove the absence of Chinese control of data and the algorithm?"" said Sarah Kreps, who focuses on technology and foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. ""You can audit millions of lines of code, but it's really hard to show one way or the other.""

A national security plan that also involved Oracle, known as Project Texas ‚Äî which gained momentum during the Biden administration ‚Äî fell short of guaranteeing TikTok's independence from ByteDance, the staffer noted, but would not elaborate, saying it involves a security vulnerability that could have given China access to the data of American users.

The Project Texas proposal to eventually collapsed when Biden officials instead chose to get behind a congressional effort to force ByteDance to sell TikTok, or face a nationwide ban.

In April, Congress attached a divest-or-ban measure to a foreign aid bill. Biden signed the bill. It gave ByteDance until Jan 19. to shed its Chinese owner.

""We gave them nine months to figure out a way to sell,"" the congressional staffer said. ""But they instead decided to fight it in court, rather than working toward divestiture.""



Opening up TikTok

One thing that is unclear: what exactly Trump means when he has said that the U.S. should be entitled to a 50% ownership of TikTok.

Some have suggested this means Trump is pushing for a partial nationalization of TikTok, others have chalked it up to imprecise language for a situation in which American private investors hold a 50% ownership stake in the company.

""Nobody seems to know what he means with the 50% equity comments,"" the source involved in the talks said.

toggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images/Getty Images North America

Chinese regulators, who have for years opposed the selling of TikTok, recently signaled that they would not stand in the way of a TikTok ownership change, saying acquisitions ""should be independently decided by the enterprises and based on market principles."" The statement, at first, does not seem to say much, but negotiators in the White House believe it indicates that Beijing is not planning to block a deal that gives American investors a majority-stake position in the company.

China experts have said Beijing may be interested in approving a TikTok sale as a negotiating tactic to try to win tariff relief in the White House.

Meanwhile, Apple and Google still have not returned TikTok to app stores after the platform went offline for about 14 hours. Without Apple and Google's support, the app is deprived of software updates. It also cannot be downloaded on Apple devices, or found in the Google Play app store.

Trump's executive order was enough for Oracle, and other web infrastructure companies, to restore TikTok's services. But other companies are not taking a gamble, including Apple and Google.

Under the TikTok ban law, supporting TikTok while it remains under the control of ByteDance can lead to hundreds of billions of dollars in fines, a punishment that can be levied a year after Trump's term.

Following a report by NPR that said the Trump administration is working on a deal with Oracle and other investors to take over TikTok in the US, Trump has denied any talks with Oracle but says he has ‚Äúspoken to many people about TikTok‚Äù and may make a decision in the next month, according to Reuters. Trump signed an executive order shortly after taking office on Monday that delays the enforcement of the TikTok ban by 75 days, giving the app‚Äôs parent company ByteDance more time to figure out a deal that would allow it to continue US operations.

NPR, citing sources ‚Äúwith direct knowledge of the talks,‚Äù originally reported that Oracle met with White House officials on Friday to discuss a deal in which Oracle and other American investors would end up with a majority stake in TikTok and oversee things like data collection. Microsoft has also been involved with the talks, according to NPR. ‚ÄúThe goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok,‚Äù an unnamed source told NPR. ‚ÄúByteDance wouldn't completely go away, but it would minimize Chinese ownership.‚Äù

When asked about a potential deal with Oracle by reporters during an Air Force One flight Saturday night, though, Trump said, per Reuters, ‚ÄúNo, not with Oracle. Numerous people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it and I will make that decision probably over the next 30 days.‚Äù

ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement

Prior to the ban going into effect on January 19, ByteDance pushed back against the idea of selling TikTok to appease US lawmakers. But it changed its tune on Sunday after Trump stepped in to temporarily bring the app back online, issuing a statement on TikTok‚Äôs X account saying that the company ‚Äúwill work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.‚Äù

It came a few hours after Trump wrote in a Truth Social post during the short-lived TikTok blackout that he ‚Äúwould like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture.‚Äù Still, his exact plan remains unclear. According to one of the sources that spoke with NPR, ‚ÄúNobody seems to know what he means with the 50 percent equity comments.‚Äù",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.5511689186096191,neutral,0.88472580909729,Neutral

In Brief

President Donald Trump told reporters that Microsoft is in talks to acquire TikTok‚Äôs U.S. operations, Bloomberg reports. Although Trump didn‚Äôt elaborate, he stated that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs great interest in TikTok‚Äù and that there will be ‚Äúa lot of people bidding on it.‚Äù

Microsoft and Oracle were in the running to acquire the ByteDance-owned app back in 2020 when Trump first pressured the social network to shed its Chinese ownership or face a ban.

Trump signed an executive order last week to delay the TikTok ban deadline by 75 days and told the Department of Justice not to enforce the ban‚Äôs penalties. While the app is back online, it‚Äôs still missing from app stores.

It‚Äôs worth noting that Perplexity AI has submitted a proposal to merge with TikTok. Billionaire Frank McCourt has also made a formal offer to buy the social network. In addition, Trump previously said he would be open to Tesla CEO Elon Musk or Oracle chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok.",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.4255623817443847,neutral,0.946503520011902,Neutral

It's not every day a humble Wi-Fi router makes an appearance in the halls of Congress. But that's exactly what happened on March 5 when Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois, held up a TP-Link router and said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use this.‚Äù

Krishnamoorthi has been urging a ban of the routers for months in response to several China-backed cyberattacks last year. Investigators at the Commerce, Defense and Justice departments all opened probes into TP-Link routers in 2024 due to ties to Chinese cyberattacks.

These departments are weighing a potential ban on the sale of TP-Link routers, The Wall Street Journal reported in December. Along with Rep. John Moolenaar, a Republican from Michigan, Krishnamoorthi spurred the investigation over the summer with a letter to the Department of Commerce calling for an immediate ban.

Locating local internet providers

A potential ban is more about the company‚Äôs links to China than specific security issues that have been publicly identified, according to cybersecurity researchers I spoke with.

TP-Link was founded in 1996 by brothers Zhao Jianjun and Zhao Jiaxing in Shenzhen, China. In October last year, it moved its headquarters to Irvine, California, two months after the House announced an investigation into the company. The company told CNET it had previously operated dual headquarters, in Singapore and Irvine.

Locating local internet providers

In the House's Select Committee on China hearing, Rob Joyce, former director of cybersecurity at the National Security Agency, also told the committee that TP-Link routers are a threat to US cybersecurity.

""We need to all take action and replace those devices so they don't become the tools that are used in the attacks on the US,"" Joyce said.

In a statement to CNET, TP-Link President Jeff Barney said, ""Witnesses at the hearing didn‚Äôt present a shred of evidence that TP-Link is linked to the Chinese government and we are not.""

TP-Link has become increasingly dominant in the US router market since the pandemic. According to the Journal report, it grew from 20% of total router sales in 2019 to around 65% this year. TP-Link disputed these numbers to CNET, and a separate analysis from the IT platform Lansweeper found that 12% of home routers currently used in the US are made by TP-Link.

""People expect there to be some smoking gun or something in these devices from Chinese manufacturers, and what you end up finding is the exact same problems in every device. It's not like the Chinese devices are glaringly insecure,"" Thomas Pace, CEO of cybersecurity firm NetRise and a former security contractor for the Department of Energy, told CNET. ""That's not the risk. The risk is in the corporate structure of every Chinese company.""

Watch this: Best Wi-Fi Routers for 2025: A Buying Guide 06:14

In my conversations with TP-Link representatives, they‚Äôve repeatedly distanced themselves from ties to China.

‚ÄúTP-Link has a secure, vertically integrated and US-owned international supply chain,‚Äù a TP-Link representative told CNET. ‚ÄúNearly all products sold in the United States are manufactured in Vietnam.‚Äù

Even so, the US government appears to see TP-Link as a Chinese entity. In August, the House Select Committee urged an investigation into the company.

‚ÄúTP-Link‚Äôs unusual degree of vulnerabilities and required compliance with [Chinese] law are in and of themselves disconcerting,‚Äù the lawmakers wrote. ‚ÄúWhen combined with the [Chinese] government‚Äôs common use of [home office] routers like TP-Link to perpetrate extensive cyberattacks in the United States, it becomes significantly alarming.‚Äù

Asked for comment, a TP-Link representative told CNET, ‚ÄúLike many consumer electronics brands, TP-Link Systems' routers have been identified as potential targets for hackers. However, there is no evidence to suggest our products are more vulnerable than those of other brands.‚Äù

CNET has several TP-Link models on our lists of the best Wi-Fi routers and will monitor this story closely to see if we need to reevaluate those choices. Though our evaluation of the hardware hasn't changed, we're pausing TP-Link routers as our top recommendation until we learn more.

Chris Monroe/CNET

A ban is more about TP-Link's ties to China than a known technical issue

The cybersecurity experts I spoke with all agreed that TP-Link had security flaws, but so do all router companies. It‚Äôs unclear whether the government has found a new issue that would lead to a potential ban on TP-Link sales.

The Wall Street Journal article cited federal contracting documents that show TP-Link routers purchased by agencies from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to the Defense Department and Drug Enforcement Administration.

The potential ban comes at a time in Washington when there is growing bipartisan support for extracting Chinese products from US telecommunications. In an attack revealed in October dubbed Salt Typhoon, Chinese hackers reportedly broke into the networks of US internet providers like AT&T, Verizon and Lumen, which owns CenturyLink and Quantum Fiber.

""Vulnerabilities in embedded devices are not unique to any one manufacturer or country of origin,"" said Sonu Shankar, chief product officer at Phosphorus Cybersecurity. ""Nation-state actors frequently exploit weaknesses in devices from vendors worldwide, including those sold by American manufacturers.""

Brendan Carr, Trump‚Äôs pick for Federal Communications Commission chairman, said in an interview with CNBC that a recent intelligence briefing on the Salt Typhoon attack ‚Äúmade me want to basically smash my phone at the end of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn many ways, the horse is out of the barn at this point,‚Äù Carr said. ‚ÄúAnd we need all hands on deck to try to address this and rein this in.‚Äù

TP-Link hasn‚Äôt been linked to the Salt Typhoon attacks, but it does show the current temperature for perceived threats from China.

Chris Monroe/CNET

The government may have identified a TP-Link vulnerability, but we don‚Äôt know for sure

Several of the cybersecurity experts I spoke with believe it‚Äôs likely that intelligence agencies have found something with TP-Link that warrants a ban.

‚ÄúI think this comes from a deeper intelligence within the US government. Usually this happens before the information becomes public,‚Äù Guido Patanella, senior vice president of engineering at Lansweeper, told CNET.

""I think it's beyond political,"" Patanella added. ""It could be either an intentionally set hardware flaw or it could be from a firmware point of view. This is usually a black box analysis and it usually doesn't get shared, as happened with Huawei.""

In 2019, Trump issued an executive order that effectively banned US companies from using network equipment from Huawei, another Chinese company that came under fire over national security concerns.

Pace, the NetRise CEO, told me he thinks it‚Äôs likely that there‚Äôs a ‚Äúzero-day‚Äù vulnerability in TP-Link devices -- a term that refers to a hidden flaw in which there have been zero days to fix it -- but he was quick to point out that there‚Äôs no evidence to back that up.

‚ÄúBut at least that claim is based in some sort of reality that we are aware of that exists, which is that the PRC (People's Republic of China) is involved in every Chinese corporation. And that's undeniable,‚Äù Pace said.

TP-Link

TP-Link has known security flaws, but so do all router companies

A TP-Link representative pointed us to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency‚Äôs list of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities. TP-Link has two of these events catalogued, compared to eight for Netgear and 20 for D-Link; other popular router brands like Asus, Linksys and Eero have none.

By this measure, TP-Link isn‚Äôt exceptional in either direction, but that might not be all that useful of a measure.

""We've analyzed an astonishing amount of TP-Link firmware. We find stuff, but we find stuff in everything,"" said Thomas Pace, CEO of cybersecurity firm NetRise and former security contractor for the Department of Energy.

‚ÄúThe problem with the CISA KEV [list] is, if everything's on the list, how good is that list?‚Äù Pace added. ‚ÄúBasically, every telecommunications device on the planet has at least one vulnerability on the CISA KEV. It's a big problem that there are not great answers to.‚Äù

There have also been several cybersecurity reports that have singled out TP-Link specifically. The most high-profile one came in October when Microsoft released details on a password spraying attack it had been tracking for over a year. In this type of attack, hackers use a single common password to access multiple accounts.

Microsoft referred to the attack as ‚Äúnation-state threat actor activity‚Äù and said TP-Link made up most of the routers used.

In May 2023, Check Point Research also identified a firmware implant in TP-Link routers linked to a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group. In this case, the campaign targeted European foreign affairs entities. Still, the researchers emphasized that the attack was written in a ‚Äúfirmware-agnostic manner‚Äù and wasn‚Äôt designed to exploit TP-Link specifically.

‚ÄúWhile our analysis focused on its presence in modified TP-Link firmware, previous incidents show that similar implants and backdoors have been used on devices from diverse manufacturers, including US based,‚Äù Itay Cohen, one of the authors of the Check Point Research report, told CNET.

‚ÄúThe broader implication is that this implant isn‚Äôt about targeting a specific brand -- it‚Äôs part of a larger strategy to exploit systemic vulnerabilities in internet infrastructure.‚Äù

Cohen said he doesn‚Äôt believe a TP-Link ban would improve security much. As I heard from other researchers, the security issues that have been identified are not unique to one company.

‚ÄúThe vulnerabilities and risks associated with routers are largely systemic and apply to a wide range of brands, including those manufactured in the US,‚Äù Cohen said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt believe that the implant we found was known to TP-Link or was knowingly inserted as a backdoor to their products.‚Äù

Chris Monroe/CNET

Is it safe to use a TP-Link router?

There are real risks associated with using a TP-Link router, but some level of risk is present no matter what brand of router you use. In general, cyberattacks tied to Chinese actors have targeted think tanks, government organizations, nongovernment organizations and Defense Department suppliers, according to the Journal‚Äôs reporting.

‚ÄúI don't think that the average person is going to have this massive target on their back,‚Äù Pace told CNET. ‚ÄúThey tend to go after the things they want to go after.‚Äù

That said, these kinds of attacks are often indiscriminate, with the goal of creating a chain of nodes between infected routers and hackers.

‚ÄúThis means regular users are at risk of being targeted as part of a broader attack campaign, even if they are not individually targeted,‚Äù said Cohen, the Check Point Security researcher.

In his first term, President Trump came to understand that TikTok was a creation of Bytedance, a company controlled by the Chinese government‚Äîspecifically the CCP. So, in August of 2020, he signed an executive order requiring the CCP-controlled ByteDance to divest TikTok. A month later that order got blocked by a court injunction. But that was reversed by the Biden administration in 2021.

As it turned out, the executive order to restructure TikTok was unenforced until 2024, when the Israeli war against Hamas intensified and TikTok‚Äôs distinctly pro-Palestinian bias was instrumental in disrupting many college and university campuses across the U.S. Congress proposed and passed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which again ordered that ByteDance divest TikTok due to alleged security concerns and pro-Palestinian bias. The bill was signed into law, and was upheld by the Supreme Court, following a lawsuit challenge from TikTok. That law set a deadline of January 19, 2025, for TikTok‚Äôs ban in the U.S. unless it divested itself from the CCP-controlled ByteDance.

The TikTok ban took another twist on Inauguration Day, January 20, 2025, when Trump signed an executive action that delays enforcement of the TikTok ban for 75 days. Some have observed that Trump thinks well of TikTok presumably because TikTok delivered a lot of youth votes on November 5.

Trump is mistaken if he thinks that the restructuring of TikTok can be pulled off quickly, given the risk of residual backdoors to China that are likely baked into the system. Everyone understands that Facebook harvests data from users‚Äô devices even when they are not on the Facebook site. According to Sam Faddis, a 20-year veteran of the CIA, Tik Tok is four to five times more intrusive than Facebook in harvesting data from Americans who have downloaded the TikTok app. And that means that all such Americans‚Äô email, text messages and other information gets sucked out of their devices and ends up on servers in China.

By some estimates, half the U.S. population, about 170 million people, are subscribers to TikTok. A good number of those users under 35 years of age are seemingly addicted to TikTok videos, which are short and cover a range of subjects‚Äîsome silly, some controversial, and others with commercial value. But make no mistake, the TikTok app together with its algorithms that were developed by Chinese engineers have created weapons aimed at the heart of the United States.

Those who think this is a free speech issue are mistaken. TikTok is a backdoor attack on unwitting Americans by a hostile communist regime. Former FBI director Chris Wray publicly testified numerous times that ‚Äúthe CCP dedicates more resources in cyber-attacks against the United States than they do against all other countries on the planet combined.‚Äù

At a recent meeting of the Committee on the Present Danger: China, Dr. John Lenczowski reminded attendees that much of the thinking of the Chinese Communist Party is rooted in a long tradition dating back 2,500 years to the war fighting philosophy of Sun Tzu, encapsulated in his written work, The Art of War, which elaborates on various approaches to strategic deception in order to defeat the enemy without having to fire a shot.

An important part of this Chinese unrestricted warfare against the U.S. is to deceive Americans into believing that mainland China is just a normal state‚Äîa country that honors international norms. The net result of some two generations of this deception warfare has been a psychological disarmament of the United States.

Lenczowski points out that TikTok is used as an avenue of cooptation of an important segment of the U.S. population. In various videos, TikTok has subliminally discredited the American system of democracy and constitutional order. At times, such as the early period of the George Floyd riots of 2020, TikTok leaders distributed videos to those whom they believed were likely to riot in favor of Black Lives Matter. And because TikTok had so much accurate information on Americans through their many years of data collection, TikTok decision-makers were able to target likely rioters. They also provided professional advice on how to do maximum damage while keeping the perpetrators safe from being arrested.

Another speaker, Grant Newsham, a retired colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps, focused on the CCP‚Äôs use of TikTok to indoctrinate the U.S. military, pointing out their ability to access the minds of all the nearly 1.3 million active-duty troops and 768,000 national guard and reserve members, as well as new recruits. He concluded by noting that ‚Äúyou just have to manipulate the military a little bit to make a military much less effective.‚Äù

In delaying the banning and dismantling of TikTok, President Trump needs to determine whether the kind of weapon the CCP has created in TikTok can be rendered benign, even if it becomes wholly owned by an American company. The Chinese are notorious for welding backdoors into their systems as they did with Huawei. We chose not to take a chance with Huawei, and we should not take a chance with TikTok when vestiges of Chinese deceptive engineering could still be present and operated.

My account was suspended for my inability to shut up about COVID authoritarianism, the lies, the coverup, and the disastrous lockdowns that destroyed our economy as well as our trust in the public health establishment, and for which the responsible parties like Anthony Fauci and Francis Collins STILL haven‚Äôt faced any consequences. I guess it‚Äôs not surprising that a Chinese-controlled social media platform wouldn‚Äôt want me talking about that stuff. But I‚Äôm not bitter.

Advertisement

In fact, I‚Äôm so not bitter that I‚Äôm going to be the bigger man and actually defend TikTok from the censorious Biden administration‚Äôs dogged determination to ban the app. Perhaps ironically, the very obsession with lockdowns that got me booted from TikTok also taught me some important lessons about the dangers of government censorship.

It‚Äôs only been a couple of years since the Twitter Files revealed the heavy hand of U.S. intelligence agencies leaning on social media platforms to suppress speech that ran against the government‚Äôs narrative on COVID. Under the guise of combating mis-, dis-, and malinformation, the Biden administration decided that social media users couldn‚Äôt be trusted to hear dissenting views. Instead, it was the job of Big Brother to step in and tell us what to believe. Now, we‚Äôre seeing similar arguments floated to justify the Tik-Tok ban.

I have no doubt that TikTok is home to Chinese propaganda, designed to paint the communist regime in a rosy light and poison the minds of young people. I also have no doubt that prolonged exposure to the platform is probably not the healthiest way to spend a childhood. That being said, it is not the proper role of government to assume parenting duties and decide what kind of media American children can and cannot be exposed to.

But more troubling than this creeping paternalism is the precedent that such a ban sets for future censorship. If this was just about TikTok, I could (almost) forgive eye-rolling from CCP critics dismissive of my First Amendment free speech absolutism. But like so many things in Washington, this debate isn‚Äôt about protecting children or stopping Chinese communist propaganda. This legislation is about empowering the same government interests behind the COVID-era Censorship Industrial Complex. If you don‚Äôt believe me, actually read the bill, as Representative Thomas Massie did. The powers given to the executive branch under the legislation authorizing the TikTok ban are broad and lacking in specific limitations. There‚Äôs no reason not to think that these same powers‚Äîto force a company to comply with government demands or else shut down‚Äîwon‚Äôt be leveraged against other social media platforms that refuse to toe the next government line.

As a libertarian, I‚Äôm no fan of government sponsored propaganda, especially when it‚Äôs coming from authoritarians wanting to control what we say, think and do. But I‚Äôm most worried when my own government uses the specter of Chinese-style manipulation and control to build the same infrastructure for future manipulation and control here. Because this is America, and free speech and free thinking and dissenting from our own government‚Äôs fake propaganda is our birthright.

Advertisement

So, even though I‚Äôm still mad about losing my account, I‚Äôm opposed to the TikTok ban as a federal overreach that violates the free speech rights of all Americans, as well as creating a framework for a more censorious tech policy in the future. If you insist we think of the children, let‚Äôs think of giving them a country where freedom is valued and protected, and not succumb to the same authoritarian tactics we criticize in China.

One of the first actions President Donald Trump took at the outset of his second presidency was granting a stay of execution for TikTok. Two and a half months later, he granted a second.

Courtesy of AXIOS, as of January 28, 2025.

Do have a ""phew!"" And click here.

President Trump is carrying out his pledge to give the U.S. a MAGA makeover by signing a slew of executive actions in his first week that walk back Biden-era policies and fulfill his campaign promises. The big picture: Trump's radical expansion of executive power will dramatically change life for millions of people if the orders withstand the barrage of legal challenges that are already coming.

President Trump executive orders list 2025

Immigration executive orders

Many of Trump's first orders curtail immigration at the southern border.

He promised mass deportations but hasn't detailed how he would implement, staff and fund such a massive, costly operation.

Trump declares national emergency at Mexico border

Trump declared an emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, vowing to deploy troops to the region, including the National Guard. He instructed the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security to construct additional border barriers.

Trump designated ""certain international cartels"" and organizations, such as Tren de Aragua and MS-13, as foreign terrorist organizations and announced plans to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to target them.

Trump suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program resettlements. Homeland Security will report back within 90 days on whether resuming refugee entries would ""be in the interests"" of America.

Nearly 1,660 Afghans cleared by the U.S. to resettle in the country, including family of active-duty U.S. military personnel, had their flights canceled following Trump's orders, Reuters reported.

Trump ordered Homeland Security to terminate ""all categorical parole programs that are contrary"" to U.S. policies established in his orders, including those for refugees fleeing Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.

Remain in Mexico policy

Trump reinstated the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, ending a program that released asylum seekers into the U.S. while their cases were considered.

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection website said appointments made through the CBP One app at certain border crossings had been canceled on Jan. 20. Hours later, Trump nixed the program.

Trump empowered officials to ""repeal, repatriate, or remove any alien engaged in the invasion"" of the southern border.

Trump birthright citizenship executive order

One of his boldest moves was an attempt to end birthright citizenship for those born to undocumented immigrants, which is protected by the U.S. Constitution. The order faces legal challenges.

Trump ordered agencies (starting 30 days after the Jan. 20 order) not to recognize babies as citizens if their mothers were ""unlawfully present"" at the time of birth and their father was not a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident.

This applies to children born to mothers who were lawful, temporary residents and fathers who were not citizens or lawful permanent residents.

Energy and environment executive orders

Trump declared a ""national energy emergency,"" ordering expedited, deregulated drilling.

One order specifically targets energy production in Alaska -- rescinding former President Biden's protections around the state's coastal areas.

Separately, Trump paused offshore wind leasing in federal waters.

""[T]he heads of all other relevant agencies, shall not issue new or renewed approvals, rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore wind projects,"" pending a review of federal wind leasing, per the memorandum.

Paris Climate treaty

State of play: Trump signed an order withdrawing the U.S., the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, from the Paris Climate Agreement.

Trump had pulled out of the pact during his first term, but Biden rejoined it in a day-one order of his own.

It takes a year to withdraw from the agreement.

Trump took aim at the Biden administration's federal procurement targets for clean power, electric vehicles and other energy goals.

Trump directed the Energy secretary to restart application reviews for liquefied natural gas export projects, which were paused by Biden over climate change concerns.

Trump also revoked a 2021 Biden executive order that set a goal for 50% of US vehicle sales to be electric by 2030.

Executive orders targeting DEI, and transgender Americans

Trump established that ""it is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female"" on official documents.

""These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,"" his Jan. 20 executive order read.

Transgender Americans were a central target of Trump's often hyperbolic and outright false campaign trail messaging.

Zoom out: He also rescinded a Biden administration provision that allowed transgender people to serve in the military.

Trump did not immediately ban trans military personnel from serving, as he did under his first administration, but he paved the path to revive the ban.

Trump, as part of his crusade against what the GOP decries as ""woke"" culture, ordered the dismantling of government diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives within 60 days .

It eliminates policies that established several diversity initiatives, including one that widened sex discrimination protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity.

In a Jan. 21 order, Trump specifically directed the Federal Aviation Administration ""to immediately return to non-discriminatory, merit-based hiring, as required by law"" and rescind DEI initiatives.

Separately, Trump ordered all executive departments and agencies to terminate what he called ""discriminatory and illegal"" preferences, policies, programs, guidance and other provisions and to ""combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.""

In doing so, he revoked decades of executive orders, including the Equal Employment Opportunity order of 1965 signed by former President Lyndon B. Johnson.

It calls for each agency to identify ""up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars.""

Trump signed several other provisions that will impact government workers .

He required a full-time return to in-office work for federal employees and ordered a hiring freeze on government positions.

The hiring freeze does not apply to the military or ""immigration enforcement, national security, or public safety.""

He reinstated his first-term Schedule F executive order, which could make it easier to fire civil servants deemed disloyal .

The order could strip employment protections from thousands of federal employees.

Employees are ""not required to personally or politically support the current President"" -- but they must ""faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,"" the order said.

Jan. 6 pardons and other clemency actions

Trump pardoned most Jan. 6 defendants (some 1,500) charged with participating in the Capitol riot and commuted the sentences of 14 others.

Among those were leaders of extremist groups the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers.

Pardoning rioters was a prominent campaign pledge, but Trump had previously said recipients would be determined on a ""case-by-case"" basis.

Zoom out: Trump announced on Jan. 21 he had signed a full and unconditional pardon for Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the unlawful Silk Road marketplace who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015.

On Wednesday, he issued a ""full and unconditional pardon"" to two police officers convicted for the 2020 murder of Karon Hylton-Brown, a 20-year-old Black man, in D.C.

Health executive orders: WHO, COVID and drug costs

Trump signed a Jan. 20 order pulling the U.S. from the World Health Organization, a process he started during his first term due to what the order claimed was ""the organization's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic ... and other global health crises,"" among other reasons.

Yes, Trump is the first felon ever elected to the presidency. However, his executive orders aren‚Äôt necessarily about committing new crimes ‚Äî though he did issue pardons for 1,500 people convicted of offenses related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol . Instead, what we‚Äôre witnessing is an administration openly disregarding existing laws, daring others to challenge its actions, and counting on either prolonged legal battles or a Trump-friendly Supreme Court to rewrite the rules in his favor.

But beyond the immediate policy impacts, there is a broader and more troubling pattern emerging: a flagrant challenge to the rule of law.

Since returning to the White House last week, President Trump has issued a flurry of executive orders on a wide range of topics. Understandably, most of the attention has focused on those most directly affected ‚Äî people facing deportation, teachers, workers in economic sectors like green technology, and Americans who rely on nonprofits that receive federal grants.

There are several examples of this approach, some relatively minor. But let‚Äôs focus on three of the most significant.

Ignoring the TikTok ban

Whether Americans like TikTok or not is beside the point. Last year, Congress passed a bipartisan law mandating that the Chinese-owned social media app would be banned in the US on Jan. 19, unless it found an American buyer.

That deadline came and went, and no sale occurred. Yet instead of enforcing the law, Trump unilaterally granted TikTok a 90-day reprieve.

The law does allow the president to issue an extension, but only under the condition that he notify Congress that a deal is actively in progress and simply needs more time to be finalized.

However, when Trump made his announcement, there was no such deal in place.

Since then, rumors have surfaced about a potential acquisition by Oracle and other investors, with assurances that all user data would be stored within the US. Trump has denied talking to Oracle, but says he‚Äôs spoken to ‚Äúmany people‚Äù about it. But it remains unclear how serious these negotiations are, what obstacles remain, or whether there is any real momentum toward a resolution.

What‚Äôs especially remarkable is that before Trump even officially took office, TikTok temporarily went offline in the US, expecting to be banned. But when Trump granted his extension, the app was reinstated, as if the company and app stores simply assumed the law wouldn‚Äôt be enforced. (TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew was likely reassured the move was fine given that he was an invited guest to Trump‚Äôs inauguration.)

Perhaps this will receive more scrutiny as we approach the new deadline. For now, though, Trump is simply getting away with ignoring the law.

Firing inspectors general

Most major federal agencies have an inspector general, a protected watchdog position tasked with maintaining ethical standards and investigating waste, fraud, and abuse. These officials play a crucial role in ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent appropriately and that agencies comply with the law.

Yet last Friday night, Trump fired nearly all of them, leaving just two in place.

Like the TikTok ban, federal law lays out a clear process for removing inspectors general. And just like with TikTok, Trump disregarded that process entirely.

Under the law, a president must give Congress 30 days notice before firing an inspector general. The reason for this safeguard is obvious: to prevent a president from abruptly shutting down investigations that might be politically inconvenient.

Legally, he has the right to install his own people, but only if he follows the proper procedure, which he didn‚Äôt.

Congress, meanwhile, did little in response. Over the weekend, lawmakers were largely silent. On Tuesday, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter urging Trump to comply with the law. It will likely be ignored.

For what it‚Äôs worth, Trump aide Stephen Miller appeared on CNN, arguing that the law itself was unconstitutional and that the president has the authority to hire and fire anyone in the executive branch as he pleases.

Halting federal spending

Since the nation‚Äôs founding, the US Constitution has made it clear that Congress controls federal spending, the so-called power of the purse.

Trump is now attempting to upend that fundamental principle.

In a vague executive order issued by the Office of Management and Budget in the middle of the night, the administration declared an immediate freeze on all federal spending related to grants, loans, and foreign aid. (On Wednesday the OMB rescinded the memo outlining order, but said the cuts would continue.)

These were funds that had already been debated, negotiated, compromised on, and approved by Congress. They weren‚Äôt discretionary funds Trump had any authority to withhold. Nevertheless, he is testing the limits of his power, signaling that he might simply refuse to comply with the law.

His move was so blatant that a federal judge quickly blocked the order, at least temporarily, while the issue is litigated.

This isn‚Äôt the first time Trump has attempted to withhold funds that Congress allocated. During his first term, he unilaterally withheld military aid to Ukraine, money that had been approved by lawmakers to help the country defend itself against Russian aggression. That action led directly to his first impeachment.

1 of 2 | President Donald Trump signs executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 23. Trump directed the Department of Justice not to enforce the TikTok ban for 75 days as he presses for a U.S. company to buy the app. Photo by Yuri Gripas/UPI | License Photo

Jan. 30 (UPI) -- The latest turn in the ongoing saga over TikTok in the United States has brought the balance of power among the three branches of government into the spotlight.

Hours after TikTok went dark, it returned with a ""thank you"" message to President Donald Trump sent to its more than 170 million U.S. users. A day before being sworn into office, Trump wielded his influence to overrule a law passed by Congress and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, delaying enforcement of the TikTok ban.

""Welcome back!"" the TikTok prompt read. ""Thanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, Tiktok is back in the U.S.!""

Norman Bishara, professor of business law and ethics in the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, told UPI the move sets up a struggle for power among the three branches of government.

""It's anybody's guess what will happen,"" Bishara said of the TikTok ban. ""The level of uncertainty has greatly increased.""

The president has expressed his desire for a U.S. company to purchase TikTok, meeting Congress' requirements. He has also proposed a joint venture between a U.S. company and ByteDance to share ownership of the company.

Trump suggested the app could be worth billions, if not trillions to a U.S. owner.

With an executive order, Trump directed the attorney general to not take any enforcement actions for 75 days, allowing service providers to continue supporting the app. Some companies like Google and Apple remain cautious, refusing to allow new downloads on their app stores.

A pause in enforcement is not an iron-clad guarantee that these companies are free of all liability, Bishara said.

""We're still trying to figure out behind the scenes what this means,"" he said. ""There could be other liability there for them. There is some ambiguity when you see what's at stake.""

UCLA law professor Andrew Verstein told UPI the ambiguity or ""opacity"" around TikTok reflects the concerns Congress and national security experts had about the app in the first place. But as the occupant of the White House had changed, so too has the level of outward concern about the app as a national security threat.

Verstein and Bishara agreed that Congress conceived a clear law to answer a valid concern about national security and China's access to U.S. users and their data. The high court affirmed its legality and former President Joe Biden, while still in office, signed off on it while sharing those concerns.

""This is Trump doing something that the statute plainly didn't envision happening and that is an assertion of executive power,"" Verstein said. ""Trump didn't make it legal for TikTok to remain in operation. What he said is the attorney general is not going to punish anyone. That is something the executive branch will sometimes do. This is a pretty aggressive and big usage of that strategy.""

Coupled with some of Trump's other early actions as president, his decision on TikTok demonstrates his willingness to push the boundaries of his executive powers.

A week after Trump's executive order, he again exercised his executive power to override Congress, ordering a sweeping freeze on federal aid, loans and grants. This unprecedented move set a pause on the distribution of funds that were congressionally approved.

Congress has the constitutional authority to direct government spending and pass laws.

On Monday night, within hours of this pause, acting Attorney General James McHenry fired the federal prosecutors in the cases against Trump in Florida and Washington, citing a lack of ""trust"" that they would assist in implementing Trump's agenda.

Federal prosecutors are typically only removed due to conduct or poor performance. A president may remove them for any legal reason but their political alignment would not be one of them.

""One thing Trump realized when he came into office this time is we have a pretty complicated government. A lot of independent choices run through the executive office,"" Verstein said. ""You might think Congress has the power of the purse. Congress can't hand out money unless the person who hands out the money hands out the money. That is an observation of how our government runs right now.""

The concerns shared by Congress and a slew of national security experts who gave testimony have not been erased in any apparent way. TikTok's ownership structure remains intact for now. It relocated its storage of U.S. user data to the United States more than a year ago and that did not sway Congress.

Chief among the national security concerns was the possibility that a U.S. official or lawmaker could be compromised by an adversarial government. In a series of hypotheticals, lawmakers expressed that future officials and lawmakers could be compromised before rising to office.

Meanwhile, lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, have active accounts on TikTok. Trump also joined, though he has not been active since the election and largely used the app to campaign.

""It does seem potentially incongruent for some of the folks with the most sensitive data we would like to be least susceptible to foreign influence being on this platform,"" Bishara said. ""There's a broader story we're seeing play out about the expertise of tech experts and political figures putting their views and experience ahead of other expert advice. This does seem to be a continuation of this relatively new story about the distrust of security experts.""

The focus has instead shifted away from national security and towards opportunity, according to Verstein.

TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew was alongside U.S. tech leaders and billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump, who originally called for the TikTok ban, has floated companies like Microsoft as potential buyers, touting its potential value.

Because TikTok is not a publicly traded company, it is not guaranteed that the public would be notified if an investor bought into the company unless their stake was substantial enough.

When a merger between major companies takes place, it is first scrutinized by the Department of Justice, which often demands that the public is notified. The Department of Justice has traditionally been wary of mergers that give the illusion of monopolization.

Last year it entered an antitrust lawsuit against Ticketmaster and Live Nation for allegedly monopolizing the live event market. The companies merged in 2010.

The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976 requires that companies file premerger notifications with the Federal Trade Commission and the antitrust division of the Department of Justice.

""The president now in office is untroubled by the monopoly issues of a big tech firm buying TikTok,"" Verstein said. ""We know the outgoing president was very worried about the monopolization of tech companies.""

""If one reads the room right now, it seems like what's changed is we have a president who is exerting muscular control over the Department of Justice and seems quite motivated to allow an American buyer to take TikTok over,"" he continued.

This exertion of control by Trump has broader implications beyond TikTok, impacting how Congress writes laws, according to Verstein.

""Trump started to play a very scrappy, very technical game to remind everyone this is the 21st century. We're not a little government run out of the Potomac by George Washington anymore,"" he said. ""It doesn't have to be this way. When you seize bargaining power and show people you have bargaining power, it can work for a while. They change accordingly. In the future, if Congress wants a TikTok ban to work regardless of the executive they can write a TikTok ban that gives every customer the power to sue Google or whomever for giving them TikTok. Trump noticed that's not the law they wrote.""",article,news_articles_text.csv,0.2216018438339233,neutral,0.9186798334121704,Neutral

I accidentally deleted TikTok when I was clearing up storage on my phone. Yes, I know, very stupid of me, I didn't realize what I had done until I remembered a second after doing so that it is not available in the app store anymore (I had forgotten). Is there a workaround to get the app on an iPhone, without a VPN since a VPN does not always work from what I hear (and I don‚Äôt want to risk losing my subscriptions and other data just for it to not work)? I would also need a Canadian form of payment, which I do not have, so I don‚Äôt think I can even download it just because of that alone. I could use the browser but it is just so much easier and convenient to use on my phone. 

I do own a Kindle Fire, but when I downloaded the APK, it doesn‚Äôt really work‚Äî the app has extremely low frame rate and I can‚Äôt upload any videos myself since my camera is horrible quality. So I‚Äôd prefer iPhone (or iPad). 

Even there is no way for me to get it back, is it even worth it? Everyone seems to think TikTok will never fully be unbanned or back in the app store, so if TikTok does not get sold and it gets banned again, we won't even be able to use it anymore that way either.

President Donald Trump marked his return to the White House on Jan. 20 with a slew of executive orders, including an indefinite hiring freeze at the IRS. Naturally, with the 2025 tax season well underway, you might be concerned that this situation might delay your tax refund -- but there's one filing choice you should be worried about a lot more.

Amid the more headline-grabbing moves Trump made on his first day -- including a delay of the contentious TikTok ban and the rolling back of clean energy initiatives -- he also ordered a hiring freeze across the federal government. This, he claimed, was a cost-saving move while the Elon Musk-fronted advisory body, the Department of Government Efficiency, looks for ways to cut government spending.

The order had special language reserved for the IRS, making the hiring freeze indefinite. And it came only a week before the start of tax season on Jan. 27, when the agency will start accepting tax returns. On average, the IRS processes about 140 million returns a year and issues refunds averaging around $3,100 apiece, but this freeze on hiring has prompted new concerns that the agency will face difficulties handling the load this year.

Read on to find out if this hiring freeze might impact your tax return. For more on tax season, find out how Direct File has been ""enhanced"" this year and see if your state has lowered its income tax rate.

What does the hiring freeze mean for the IRS?

The hiring freeze ordered by Trump specifies that ""no Federal civilian position that is vacant at noon on January 20, 2025, [to] be filled"" for 90 days. This period will last past the typical April 15 tax filing deadline, and on top of that, the order singled out the IRS for an indefinite hiring freeze.

""This memorandum shall remain in effect for the IRS until the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Director of OMB [Office of Management and Budget] and the Administrator of USDS [United States Digital Service], determines that it is in the national interest to lift the freeze,"" the order states.

Will the IRS hiring freeze impact my tax return?

If the IRS has any concerns about its ability to process tax returns in the next few months, it hasn't said so in an official capacity. In a post to LinkedIn, however, Melanie Lauridsen, the vice president for tax policy and advocacy for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, suggested that the freeze should have no significant impact on the IRS' ability to fill seasonal roles for tax filing season, as that sort of hiring should already have been done.

""There is NO CONCERN for the April 15 tax filing season as far as hiring seasonal employees for the filing season. Seasonal employees should have already been hired and received training to begin working from January through May. The IRS will also reallocate workers from other areas to help cover filing season processing.""

Will my refund be delayed?

Concerns about your potential tax refund will fall under the same umbrella as your return in general, which is to say, the IRS hasn't commented but it's looking unlikely at this point that there will be major delays.

Are there any ways I can speed up my tax refund?

For the time being, it seems like you might not need to be concerned about your tax return getting processed in a timely manner this year, but beyond the current situation, there are a few steps you can take to speed up your taxes considerably.

For starters, obviously, you can file your return as soon as possible, if that's something you're able to do. As mentioned above, the IRS will accept your return as soon as Monday, Jan. 27. This might, however, not be the best choice for you if you want to claim the child tax credit.

TikTok‚Äôs potential U.S. ban has sparked a flurry of development within the open social web community. Several new applications are being built that could one day serve as a TikTok replacement for those who favor the open source, decentralized social network Bluesky and the technology that powers it, the AT Protocol.

Though the TikTok ban is currently on pause after President Trump gave parent company ByteDance a 75-day extension to negotiate a deal, the fact that the government was able to take down TikTok in the first place has users worried about its future. Meanwhile, creators and small businesses are stressed over how the loss of TikTok could affect their income.

Building a ‚ÄúTikTok for Bluesky‚Äù

One solution emerging to address the problem is Bluesky, a decentralized, open source social network where you can choose your own server and algorithm and adjust your moderation controls to your own needs. Plus, if you ever decide to change servers, you can move your account easily without losing your username, friends, or posts. You can even ‚Äúrun your own Bluesky‚Äù by setting up a personal data server or relay.

Designed for a future web, Bluesky allows people to take back control over their personal data and social activity from Big Tech ‚Äî an effort also supported by the open social ecosystem called the fediverse, which runs on a different protocol and includes apps like Mastodon and others.

There are now several new projects underway to bring a video experience to Bluesky, whether that‚Äôs as a video-first Bluesky client or as an entirely new app built on the same AT Protocol that Bluesky uses.

Below are a few of the video apps in various stages of development that are focused on catering to Bluesky users.

Bluescreen

Built by Berlin developer Sebastian Vogelsang, who previously launched the Bluesky client app Skeets, Bluescreen is an upcoming app that will focus on videos posted to the Bluesky social network. Similar to his Instagram alternative Flashes, which is also in the works, Bluescreen is being built quickly thanks to Vogelsang‚Äôs ability to reuse some of the same code from Skeets.

Like Flashes, Bluescreen would offer a video-first Bluesky experience, as it filters your current Bluesky feeds and lists for video content, while also allowing uploads. Because it‚Äôs built on Bluesky‚Äôs network, your videos will also appear on your profile on the official Bluesky app, and people‚Äôs comments and other engagement with those videos will show up in the Bluescreen app.

Vogelsang built his first prototype of Bluesky in just under two hours, he says, and has since been posting sneak peeks of the app on the Bluescreen account on Bluesky as it‚Äôs further refined.

The app features a set of interaction buttons similar to what TikTok has, including Likes, Comments, Saves/Bookmarks, and more.

Reelo

Reelo represents a larger effort at building a TikTok-like app that appeals to Bluesky users, but unlike other efforts, it‚Äôs not just a layer or filter on top of Bluesky‚Äôs existing social network. Instead, Reelo is developing its own stand-alone app on the AT Protocol. That means Reelo will benefit from the same sort of transparency and control over your data as on Bluesky, but it will be free of the limitations of building on top of Bluesky directly.

This allows Reelo to support more features, including longer videos of up to three minutes, special effects, a music and sounds library, and later, livestreaming. Users will be able to directly post their video content on the app. As the company explains in a post on Bluesky, this makes for a ‚Äúricher, more tailored video experience‚Äù compared with other apps built on Bluesky, like rival Skylight, for example.

However, building its own app on AT Protocol instead of creating an app that‚Äôs just a layer on Bluesky itself means a longer development timeline. Reelo expects to have the front end and back end completed by the end of February with a launch on March 20, after an initial testing period.

Image Credits:Reelo

Like most of the apps in development, Reelo also looks a lot like TikTok, with a vertical video feed and ways to like, comment, and share on the right-hand side of the screen.

Skylight

The team behind Skylight has been working to build a TikTok alternative after Mark Cuban said he was interested in backing potential startups in this space.

The team behind the app includes Seattle-based co-founders Victoria (‚ÄúTori‚Äù) White, who has a background in building custom websites and apps, and React developer Reed Harmeyer. The founders are marketing Skylight as an ‚ÄúAT Protocol TikTok,‚Äù which is technically correct because Bluesky itself runs on AT Protocol.

However, by building Skylight as a layer on top of the existing Bluesky platform, the app runs into limitations.

Bluesky‚Äôs social network limits videos to up to 60 seconds in length and 50MB in size. In other words, if Skylight wants to add support for longer videos or other features, it would need to wait for Bluesky to change its own guidelines or develop its own dedicated app built on AT Protocol. (Skylight‚Äôs founders declined an interview, so it‚Äôs not clear what their long-term roadmap looks like.)

Skylight does have an advantage of sorts, as its video-focused app is already in beta testing on iOS and Android, allowing early adopters to try it out ahead of its public release.

App features include likes, follows, comments, and profile pages. Video uploads are still in the works.

Videos for Bluesky

Recently launched on the App Store, the generically named Videos for Bluesky is another app built on top of Bluesky itself. This new app comes courtesy of ‚ÄúMszPro,‚Äù aka Hoshida Takiyoshi, an indie Japanese developer.

Takiyoshi has always loved experimenting, having built around 60 apps to date, including the SoraSNS app offering combined access to decentralized networks Mastodon, Bluesky, Misskey, and Firefish.

Like some of the others, Videos for Bluesky lets you browse videos posted to the Bluesky social network by vertically scrolling in a TikTok-like user interface with familiar Like, Repost, and Reply buttons.

The app also features user profiles, built-in search, follow buttons, and its own local ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù timeline featuring trending videos as well as ways to view other videos from people you follow or any custom feeds. In addition, the app is designed with an algorithm that will learn your interests over time, the developer says.

Its recent updates have added support for other features like notifications and a new post composer focused on video uploads, among other things.

With a one-time ‚ÄúPro‚Äù unlock in-app purchase, users can access post analysis information and watch videos from a custom timeline.

Soon, it will add NSFW filtering, a video recorder, style filters, downloads, bookmarks, and more.

The Videos for Bluesky app is iOS-only, but if there‚Äôs enough user demand, the developer will consider building an Android version.

‚ÄúBluesky is still a relatively new platform, but its well-documented protocol makes it easy for indie developers like myself to integrate new features,‚Äù Hoshida notes. ‚ÄúUnlike centralized social media, Bluesky‚Äôs API doesn‚Äôt require app makers to register for a developer account, which helps more people jump in and start building right away. And of course, since it is open source, developers can easily look into the code to see how to interact with various API features.‚Äù

Later, the developer plans to work on other social apps, including one for Bluesky focused on photos and a news reader for the fediverse.

Flipboard‚Äôs Surf

While Flipboard‚Äôs newest app Surf is more than just a video aggregator, the app recently added a video feed of its own after Bluesky added its custom video feed.

Surf initially focused on video posts from Bluesky‚Äôs trending video feed and others that included the hashtag #SkyTok,‚Äù but it aims to soon personalize the feed to the end user in future developments. The latter would differentiate it from Bluesky‚Äôs video feed and make it more interesting to each individual user.

Bluesky‚Äôs video feed is available in the Surf app, where people can also build their own custom feeds to track all sorts of posts across the open social web, including Bluesky, Mastodon, RSS, and more.

Surf is still in private beta testing, but a signup list is available for people who are interested.

Canceled: BlueSky Reels

On 2/1/24, Merry said he was abandoning the project. The original information is below:

BlueSky Reels (its website is not yet live) is another project that sees the potential for a TikTok replacement in the market. Developed by Craig Merry, the client will support video only, as well as basic user interactions. Over time, support for other personal data servers besides Bluesky‚Äôs own could be included.

The app‚Äôs content comes from Bluesky itself, though the goal is to add more features that Bluesky doesn‚Äôt have.

‚ÄúMy main goal is to build an easy way for people to create curated feeds ‚Äî with content that can be moderated directly ‚Äî much like moderation in Reddit,‚Äù Merry explains.
